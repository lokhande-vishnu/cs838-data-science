But the neighbors seem to be enjoying it, filing under the awning of fish-scale shingles to take their places on wooden chairs painted blue, yellow and hot pink.""},{""Review"":""On the black-and-white letter board that lists the daily specials is a note proclaiming “No pad Thai zone.” This may be true, but it gives the impression that Fish Cheeks is going to take you on a wild ride careening down the unmarked back roads of Thai cuisine. This isn’t quite accurate.""},{""Review"":""The Suansilphongs, in fact, serve tom yum, the sour and spicy soup that can be found at almost every Thai restaurant in the land; often it’s watery and acrid. The version here hums with fresh galangal, lime leaves and lemongrass. Shrimp and knobby mushrooms simmer in a broth that gets extra body from milk, a twist I’ve never seen before but one I approve of. It could be spicier, but the use of bird’s-eye chiles is far from shy.""},{""Review"":""Woon sen, the transparent noodles that are almost as widespread as tom yum, are baked with shrimp and pork belly in a sweet, Chinese-influenced casserole. From southern Thailand comes a lush and complex crab curry, rich from coconut milk and hypnotically aromatic from freshly ground spices.""},{""Review"":""Nam tok, a northeastern salad of grilled meat with green herbs and shallots, is another familiar sight, but the pork is more flavorful than usual, with a deeply satisfying char on the edges. And I wish every Thai restaurant could make fried chicken with shallot rings and a classic sweet red-chile dipping sauce that is as engaging as the appetizer version at Fish Cheeks.""},{""Review"":""If you’ve ever eaten a Thai seafood dish that was undermined by the shallow-pond flavor of farmed fish, you’ll understand why I hope the Suansilphongs keep using local bluefish. In one recurring special, they steam a big skin-on fillet and serve it in a pot that bubbles as it lands on the table. The broth is mild on its own, but the spicy green nam jim sauce and the fresh bird’s-eye chiles liberally tossed over the top are exactly the kinds of aggressive partners that bluefish enjoys sparring with.""},{""Review"":""Bird’s-eye chiles also brought a pleasantly psychedelic level of heat to raw butterflied shrimp flash-marinated in fish sauce, lime and garlic. The dish turns up at Somtum Der, among other local restaurants, and the version here is forceful enough to suggest that the brothers have faith that people on Bond Street can take a little pain.""},{""Review"":""For the ones who like to walk on the mild side, there is a very likable branzino that has been fried to a golden crackle with garlic. On the side is a dish of fish sauce, which you should dump on top. It’s almost laughably uncomplicated, and while I wouldn’t try to make a meal of it alone, it’s useful as a spacer between more intense bites.""},{""Review"":""I would recommend Fish Cheeks even more loudly if the cooking had been more consistent. Pad cha, a stir-fry of mixed seafood with wild ginger, little eggplants and grapelike clusters of green peppercorns, was bracingly intense one night. It was unremarkable a week later, and green-lipped mussels in a perfectly good galangal and lemongrass broth had been cooked so furiously they were rubbery.""},{""Review"":""On the short list of mixed drinks, I didn’t object to the iced tea with Cognac, which tasted like a Southeast Asian milk punch. The old-fashioned was bitter in ways that didn’t help it make its case, though, and the mango sticky-rice cocktail simply made me wish I could have mango sticky rice.""},{""Review"":""There’s just one dessert on the menu, a Thai tea panna cotta. Servers usually mentioned it offhandedly, as if it didn’t make much difference whether you ordered it or not. This turned out to be the case.""},{""Review"":""But nobody judges Thai restaurants by their desserts. What comes before is what counts, and Fish Cheeks had won me over by the end of the meal. It’s not a groundbreaking restaurant; it simply cooks the way I wish more Thai kitchens did.""}]","55 Bond Street,

Yes, she makes her own kimchi. Then she caramelizes it, just enough to draw out its sweet, gingery contours without sacrificing crunch, and deploys it in a “paella” of sushi rice flipped in a wok with tiger shrimp, mussels and Parmesan. The cheese gives it the density of risotto; the wok leaves a ghost imprint of smoke.""},{""Review"":""Pajeon, a patchwork pancake of scallions, shrimp, octopus and squid, is more traditional, although she has tinkered with the batter, sifting together different flours (she won’t say which) for a thicker, fluffier finish. The surface crackles, and the interior deflates slowly under the teeth. She has calibrated her own ponzu, too, letting it ferment for 30 days to round out the salt and soften the citrus sting.""},{""Review"":""Octopus, tender and charred, is paired with a lean chardonnay in the form of a bracing gelée.

Her version of tteokbokki supplants the usual chewy rice-cake stubs with squishier, less satisfying Italian gnocchi. Twice-fried chicken, skin ready to fracture, is coated with a sauce close to syrup that suggests congealing lacquer. In another dish, hwe (raw fish, here yellowfin tuna) huddles over soba in a chilled broth that tastes achingly of sugar and vinegar.""},{""Review"":""Ms. Hyun runs Thursday Kitchen — the sixth restaurant to occupy this space in the last seven years — with her husband, Sean Hwang, and Jeremy Seong, a colleague from Kristalbelli.

I met a paid line-stander who said that waiting outside a restaurant for three to four hours paled beside his greatest achievement: camping out in front of the Supreme Court for more than a week on behalf of a client who wanted to hear the oral arguments in the same-sex marriage case.""},{""Review"":""Absorbing as these intervals were, I felt relief and joy each time the four bamboo blinds would be raised in unison at 5:30 by four servers, one of whom would then unlock the door and start filling the 24 seats.""},{""Review"":""Genevieve Villamora, the partner who most often handles this task, has compared it to a game of Tetris. The largest tables hold just four people, as some parties of five or six have learned to their regret. All the other seats are jimmied into blind alleys and passageways around the open kitchen. Once they are all taken, Ms. Villamora takes names and numbers for openings later in the night.""},{""Review"":""With a woven Filipino mat on the wall and light filtering down from geometric slashes in a ceiling of oxidized-steel tiles, the restaurant has a certain compulsory intimacy. It’s easy to strike up a conversation with somebody, although it won’t necessarily be the somebody you arrived with. Seated at a shallow ledge in the back one night, I stood up to talk to one of my dining partners, who was three seats away. The arrangement had a cocktail-party charm until I was asked to return to my seat; I was blocking the path to the restroom.""},{""Review"":""Clearly, Bad Saint was built to make the best of its scarce square footage, not to handle the pressure of being one of Washington’s most sought-after restaurants. Now it has to do both, because the food that Tom Cunanan and his cooks prepare under columns of wok smoke is richly compelling no matter how many prior run-ins you’ve had with Filipino food.""},{""Review"":""Most people with a glancing knowledge of the cuisine have tried an adobo, a garlic-laden stew braised in soy sauce that’s been soured with vinegar. But Bad Saint’s adobo of tender squid is still astonishing, its sauce deepened and darkened by squid ink and given a slow, lingering burn by long peppers.""},{""Review"":""The oxtails and bok choi stewed in peanut sauce with an intense undercurrent of shrimp and anchovies is amazing whether this is your first encounter with kare-kare or your hundredth.""},{""Review"":""I love bitter melon, but even the skeptics I’d brought with me were won over by Bad Saint’s stir-fry, in which the vegetable’s aggressive tendencies are offset by fermented black beans, softened by eggs and sweetened by a topcoat of fried shallots. My guests were even more dubious about pancit canton, a Filipino lo mein that can be reassuringly bland. As interpreted by Mr. Cunanan, with lots of royal trumpet mushrooms and a steady thrum of Calabrian chiles, it is startlingly good.""},{""Review"":""Ms. Villamora and her partner in the restaurant, Nick Pimentel, have Filipino heritage but were born and raised in the United States. (The restaurant’s name is derived from St. Malo, La., the first Filipino settlement in this country.) Mr. Cunanan was born in the Philippines and has called his mother his main inspiration in the kitchen. Some of the cooking has a homey simplicity, like the arroz caldo, chicken in a ginger-laced rice porridge that can be cranked up with a dab of red chile paste or left to its own, soothing charms.""},{""Review"":""In other dishes, Mr. Cunanan stretches tradition to wrap it around local ingredients. In the Philippines, laing would be made by stewing dried taro leaves in coconut milk. At Bad Saint, the leaves are kale, braised to a velvety tenderness and swaddled in Chesapeake crab meat. This laing is so luxuriously flavorful, I can’t get it out of my head, and I don’t want to.""},{""Review"":""If you don’t get into the first seating, you might spend the cocktail hour checking the screen on your phone while you wait a few doors down at Room 11, also owned in part by Mr. Pimentel. Once you gain entry, you can have one of the Filipino-influenced mixed drinks like the Chili Manilli (spicier than I wanted with this food) or a home-brewed green mango soda (lovely).""},{""Review"":""Bad Saint carried about three wines when it opened. Now the selection is almost long enough to be called a list, and is wisely centered on lively, aromatic bottles like a red grenache from Tarragona or a still white from Catalonia that is a blend of xarello and riesling. The beers are even more esoteric and reflect this restaurant’s easy assurance that people come here to be turned on to something new.""},{""Review"":""I especially admire Bad Saint’s refusal to translate Filipino food into the European-derived idioms of fine dining. When the servers say the dishes are served family style, they mean it. There’s no artfully blank space on the plates, no Abstract Expressionist smears of sauce. The food goes from the wok to the plate, and it is relentlessly delicious.""},{""Review"":""Because the cuisine of the Philippines is so closely tied to home cooking, it’s been hard to imagine what a three-star Filipino restaurant would look like. Now I know that it looks like Bad Saint.""}]",3226 11th Street NW,null,Philippine
