Asian Spicy Curry

46 Mulberry Street,
212-608-7440
Chinatown grows quiet here at night, near the southern end of Mulberry Street.   stands where
Mulberry bends, between a funeral-supply shop and a dry cleaner. There are Chinese characters on the
window, but the menu knows no borders: lox and <dish>French toast</dish> for breakfast, <dish>pierogies</dish>, <dish>paninis</dish> and
<dish>linguine pomodoro</dish> for jury-duty lunch, bubble tea for kids just freed from school. Come dark, the
dining room dims and the TV goes black. Butcher paper is neatly clipped over the metal tabletops.
Votive candles start brooding. The quick set change signals the arrival of a new chef in the
kitchen, Yip Khuan Thye, a native of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bearing curry leaves and candlenuts.
Since April, this transformation has taken place almost nightly under a somewhat ungainly name,  .
The name is vague where the food is distinct: The curries draw from Malay, Indian and Chinese
traditions, and are spicy only in the most literal sense, brimming over with spices rather than
packing heat. The curries on the succinct, single-minded menu are priced at $6 or $7, each a small
world. Some are curry soups, with cloudy rust-red broths that suggest cream of velvet, thick with
coconut and riled by fish paste. In one bowl, theyâ€™re topped with fat coils of shrimp,<dish> spongy fish
cake</dish> and squid; in another, <dish>string beans and okra</dish> that snap against the teeth. One night, a curry
soup special took a sheet of crackling tofu skin as a canopy. Under it were triangles of tofu the
size of tea sandwiches and stubs of eggplant, all stuffed with fish paste and strewn with more tofu
skin, shattered, a glorious bronzed debris. Each soup comes with your choice of noodles: doughy
bands of ho fun; <dish>lo mein</dish>, as thin and symmetrical as pencils; and <dish>mei fun</dish>, flimsy angel hair. The
waitress is likely to recommend mixing two, for contrast. Ho fun and lo mein, separated by degrees
of chewiness, make a good tangle. The other curries, hefty plates of chicken or beef, are paired
with <dish>jasmine rice</dish> or crescents of roti flaking at the center, with edges worth gnawing on. Ground
candlenuts bring lushness, crushed mint a muted brightness. Both are even better with a daub (or
several) of the accompanying belacan, <dish>fermented shrimp paste</dish> fulminating with chile. (You may
politely ignore a dish of mysteriously bland noodles inked with sweet black soy sauce and heaped
with shredded chicken, which a waitress explained was intended for curry-shy children.)
