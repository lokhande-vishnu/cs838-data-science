Italian, Pizza

Do not ignore that jar of pickled chile peppers, placed surreptitiously on your table before the pizza arrives. Scatter its contents over any of <dish>Speedy Romeo’s pies</dish> and you will receive, if not visions, at least a temporary sense that all is right with the world.
The pizzeria opened in January in a former auto-parts shop. The cooks wear striped mechanics’ shirts with name patches sewed on. Giant industrial fans loom above sleek banquettes and perky orange-seated chairs.
The <dish>pizza</dish> is thin-crust, fired in a wood-burning oven but more chewy than charred. A dusting of ultra-soft double-zero flour, pollenlike, throws in some crunch. It is a fine canvas for smoky house-made mozzarella engulfing wild mushrooms and splattered with a runny fried egg ($16), or curling petals of soppressata and fennel-infused finocchiona ($16).
In an homage to St. Louis-style pizza ($16), Provel, a Velveeta-esque mixture of Cheddar, Swiss and provolone, forms a white seal over the dough, broken up here and there by tiny atolls of Italian sausage. (Pepperoni is immured below.) Ingratiatingly creamy, it may inspire awe or horror.
The rest of the menu is respectable without being exciting: beets and ricotta ($12), over-heaped crostini ($10), lemon-dabbed whole branzino ($19).
In the open kitchen hangs a photo showing the source of the restaurant’s name: a world champion chestnut harness-racing horse famed for winning in both gaits, the trot and the pace. The chef, Justin Bazdarich, is something of a switch-hitter himself: he worked for Jean-Georges Vongerichten for a decade.
You might wish a little more Jean-Georges finesse was on display. But the neighborhood approves, and for now, that is enough.
