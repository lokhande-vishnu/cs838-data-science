Golden cans of Inca Kola are stacked behind the counter of Chicks To Go, a Peruvian pollería (<dish>rotisserie-chicken</dish> shop) that opened in March a block from Rockaway Beach. Invented in 1935 in Lima, Peru, the chartreuse-yellow soda — infused with lemon verbena, an herb native to the Andes, and tasting of caramelized Sprite, Bubble Yum and jackfruit — is one of the few in the world to outsell Coca-Cola on its home turf.

The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges supposedly drank it while climbing Machu Picchu, to combat the effects of altitude. One piercingly sweet sip reminds you of the breadth of the world.

The soda’s presence at Chicks To Go is a point of cultural pride. And its sweetness makes it a fitting antipode to the outstanding pollo a la brasa: <dish>chicken</dish> saturated for half a day with cumin, oregano, garlic, soy and ají panca pepper, with its hint of smoke and berries, then turned over the flame until the skin blisters and shimmers and the juices run mad within.

The restaurant’s owners, Leyla and Ximena Yrala, are sisters from Lima who settled in the Rockaways a decade ago. Ximena developed the recipe with Emmanuel Piqueras, a Peruvian chef and proponent of Novoandina cuisine, a modern take on indigenous cooking. (He also contributed dishes to La Cevichería, a concession stand that the Yrala sisters run on the boardwalk.) Isaias Aguilar, from Mexico, monitors the bronzing of the chickens, up to 20 at a time on the spits.

These may be ordered whole ($13), halved ($8) or quartered ($4.50). The last option requires a declaration in favor of either light (breast and wing) or dark (leg and thigh); better to have it all. The meat is so succulent, it hardly needs the proffered sauces of huacatay, Peruvian black mint closer in flavor to tarragon; ají amarillo, akin to a Scotch bonnet but tamer, with a twinge of citrus; and rocoto chile, which has a shorter fuse and strangely voluptuous heat.

<dish>French fries</dish> are the classic accompaniment to pollo a la brasa, but I preferred <dish>rice and beans</dish> to catch every drop of runoff. There are plantains, too, green and garlicky or ripe and sweet, with a tableside squeeze of cinnamon-sugar-cane syrup, borrowed from the traditional Peruvian dessert picarones (fritters of squash and sweet potato).

Some <dish>rotisserie chickens</dish> wind up in ají de gallina, a creamy stew of ají amarillo, crushed walnuts and Parmesan, all the more luxurious when it spills out of an otherwise ordinary-looking empanada. Others are destined for the wok, where a quick fling with rice, snow peas, bacon, soy and oyster sauce yields chaufa, from the Chinese chao fan (<dish>fried rice</dish>). This was a gift from the Chinese immigrants who worked Peru’s sugar plantations and guano mines in the 19th century. In lieu of <dish>rice</dish>, ask for quinoa, which arrives on the plate like fluffy rubble.

Pollo saltado is another debt to the Chinese, a stir-fry of chicken and thick slashes of tomato and onions, underscored by soy, with flickers of cilantro and ají amarillo. (The dish is usually made with beef, but this is a pollería.) It comes with both <dish>French fries</dish> and <dish>rice</dish>, an excellent marriage.

Elsewhere, <dish>French fries</dish> are united with <dish>hot dogs</dish>, sliced in diagonals like oversize thumbs and fried to a brooding scarlet: salchipapas, a small debauchery commonly credited to Lima and now general to Latin America. All three sauces are spooned on top and promptly become one; a confetti of romaine counters with crunch.

Chicks To Go is mostly a takeout shop, clean and minimal. There is one table for dining in, a metal kitchen island surrounded by blocks of wood for chairs. These are modeled after the box-shaped Afro-Peruvian drum called cajón, which you play by sitting on top and striking the sides with your hands. Food is presented in wood-weave bowls; the sun idles at the windows.

But the sea is so close, making like a mirror, with that shine on the air that never quite rubs off. Follow the taste of salt. The crowd may be umbrella to umbrella, but this is still one of the city’s finest dining rooms.
