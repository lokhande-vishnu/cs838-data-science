Souvlaki GR
Greek
116 Stanton Street,
212-777-0116
It is far from the Cyclades, this begrimed block of the Lower East Side. Yet here is bougainvillea spilling over a blazing white wall, a cobblestone sidewalk washed white, and doors in that impossible Aegean blue.
Inside, there is more bougainvillea, spiraling to the ceiling; more cobbles underfoot; and everywhere the color of the sea.
So the flowers are fake, the stones painted on, and the doors and shutters open to nowhere. You will not care. Somehow it feels genuine.
This is due in no small part to the subtle ministrations of the host and co-owner, Abby Sierros, whose laid-back chic calls to mind a young bohemian Jackie O. Greek-American by marriage, she runs Souvlaki GR with her husband, Pavlos Sierros, and Kostas Plagos.
In New York it is easy to become inured to the charms of souvlaki. Who has not suffered a tough, ashen skewer at a misbegotten street fair and thought “Nevermore”? It was for this that Souvlaki GR was born, first as a food truck, which began plying the streets last summer (and continues to roam), then as a restaurant in March.
There is little here beyond the original food-truck menu, and that is fine. The pork and chicken are moist and tender, with a whiff of char. Both come meticulously cubed, on skewers ($2 or 6 for $10) or straitjacketed in a pita ($4.50). Spices and garnishes are minimal and effective: tomato, red onion, a splash of tzatziki (yogurt sauce laced with cucumber, garlic and dill). A handful of thick French fries are tucked in there, too, the way it is done in Greece, adding salt and crunch.
Swap in bifteki, ground-beef patties, and you have the <dish>Greek burger</dish> ($5.50). Stuff it with the archetypal Greek 
 and you have the <dish>veggie pita</dish> ($4).
Portions are small. You will also need the oregano-dusted <dish>Greek fries</dish>, heaped with feta ($5). Or, to share, <dish>pikilia</dish> ($10), a plate of mezedes that includes a blushing pink <dish>taramosalata</dish> (<dish>fish roe</dish> whipped with lemon, potatoes and olive oil) and <dish>smoky</dish> melitzanosalata (<dish>roasted eggplant purée</dish>).
Soon there will be beer and wine. For now you must settle for 
 ($2.50), a nonalcoholic tribute to ouzo, the Greek anise-flavored liquor. A flare in the nostrils, a smack of licorice and cane sugar — it is not quite the real thing, but enough.
