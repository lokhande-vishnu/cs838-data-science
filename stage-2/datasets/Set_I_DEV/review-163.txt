COULD the <dish>clam roll</dish> become the new lobster roll? Two new Brooklyn restaurants are betting so. It
would be a return to glory: New York once supplied most of the nation’s hard-shelled clams. Canarsie
Indians thrived on mollusks from the stream that became the Gowanus Canal. Nowadays, the old mill
buildings and warehouses along this industrial waterway hold a salty allure for arty types; the
former wasteland downhill from Park Slope is starting to look like Williamsburg. You can experience
the change at     an urban clam shack a cherrystone’s throw from the canal. It is   with a kitchen
led by the Brooklyn restaurant veteran Alan Harding (Gowanus Yacht Club, Patois). On opening nights
for the neighboring gallery, hipsters wait for seating amid Littleneck’s whitewashed wainscoting and
cute nautical doodads. Andy Curtin, an owner looking more shipmate than band mate in a beard and
woolen cap, swoops about with dishes you’ll be happy to dine on: specials like huge, scrumptious,
head-on shrimp, baked in salt with a <dish>touch of tarragon</dish> ($12); snappy, fascinating   like pea shoots
with bittersweet popcorn shoots, watermelon radishes and <dish>golden beets</dish> ($8). <dish>Meaty corkscrew whelks</dish>
are perfect in drawn garlic butter ($1 each). <dish>Urchins</dish> are creamy embodiments of sea ($6 each). The
fabulous bicoastal   selection ($2 for East Coast, $3 for West) delivers bracing, diverse pleasures
vividly described by the waitresses — British Columbian Kusshis have a “slight melon flavor,”
Chincoteagues are “kind of lemony.” The oysters are even better than their compadre shellfish. The
eponymous clams on the half shell are tender and mellow ($1.50), but the chowder — white rather than
red at this self-proclaimed New England-style shack — wants for creaminess to balance all the
pepper, and the clams within it are chewy ($7). Half <dish>the bowl of big, sweet steamers</dish> ($13) might
arrive shut tight, while the other half are so soft, they nearly disintegrate with handling. The
<dish>clipper-ship-size clam roll</dish> ($16) pretty much redeems the mollusk; <dish>fat-bellied fried Ipswiches</dish> burst
from their griddled split-top roll. Dressed in spicy tartar sauce, the clams taste swell, though
their batter, sadly, lacks crunch. Still, the clam roll trounces the <dish>mayonnaise-drowned lobster roll</dish>
($18).
