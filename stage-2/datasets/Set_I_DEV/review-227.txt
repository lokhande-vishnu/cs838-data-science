Here it is, a <dish>little soup dumpling</dish> in its swirled debutante skirt, looking so innocent, until you bite its neck and the steam roils out.

Let it rage. It’s a last gasp, before you suck up the broth within.

Nearly everything on the menu at Yaso Tangbao in Downtown Brooklyn summons up the streets of Shanghai: those soup dumplings like sleeping volcanoes, waiting for a trigger; <dish>giant shaggy pork-belly meatballs</dish>, called lion’s heads, majestic and mystifyingly airy; a cool, monochromatic huddle of <dish>chicken thigh</dish>, poached and submerged in Shaoxing rice wine, that tastes gentle, with vague allusions to <dish>mushrooms</dish> and licorice (though if you eat too much, it may make your head swim).

Then there is sauerkraut, tucked into two tightly wound spring rolls, darkly bronzed and glistening, giving no hint of their unorthodox interior. It is an excellent innovation: Often spring rolls are dipped in vinegar, but here the pickled flavor is already inside, bracing, alongside its precursor, fresh Napa cabbage, and <dish>ground chicken</dish>.

Zongxing Tu, the chef, worked in Germany in the 1980s before coming to New York and making his name as a master of soup dumplings at the first Joe’s Shanghai in Flushing, Queens.

But his sauerkraut spring rolls taste less German than Chinese — perhaps because sauerkraut may be traced back two millenniums to the building of the Great Wall, when laborers fortified themselves with fermented cabbage. Later, legend has it, the sour vegetable caught Genghis Khan’s fancy, and his hordes bore it west.

Mr. Tu, 58, is the resident yaso (uncle, in Shanghainese dialect), a mentor to his 26-year-old partners, Chi Zhang, Kevin Gu and Chongwu Du. All four grew up in Shanghai; the young men went to high school together and came to the United States to study, respectively, at Brandeis, Georgetown and Brown.

They gave up jobs in banking and international affairs to open Yaso Tangbao in October, next to a Papa John’s, on a cluttered strip not known for authentic Chinese cooking.

The only nod to heritage in the semi-industrial space is a wall of vintage ads from 1920s and ’30s Shanghai, an era of carefully crimped hair and ruby lips. You will have time to ponder them as you wait to pounce on a seat at one of the long wooden communal tables. Orders are placed at a counter in the back, where you may witness your <dish>soup dumplings</dish> being made in a glassed-in room.

It is hard to stop talking about those dumplings. (Tangbao is the general category of soup dumplings; the versions made here are best known as xiao long bao, little basket buns.) Their skins may not be the thinnest in town, but the touch of doughiness is just enough to protect the broth and cut the richness of the pork — or, better yet, pork and blue crab, with its memories of sea shallows and eelgrass.

I could go on about the cold noodles, too, exemplars of their kind, slippery rather than sticky, tasting as much of sesame as of peanuts. And a braised beef noodle soup, suffused with star anise, which had more flavor the deeper I got.

And kao fu, rough hunks of pliant, <dish>protein-rich wheat gluten</dish>, whose Mandarin name translates as the delightfully texture-specific “dough tendon.” Soy sauce and sugar leak from its pores; black wood-ear mushrooms add sponginess, while peanuts add salt and crunch.

<dish>Pork buns</dish> come not with loose tongues of lacquered pork belly but with pork ground and sealed inside, along with some of the pork-stock gelatin otherwise reserved for <dish>soup dumplings</dish>. They are sized to fit in your palm and slightly sweet, with a crisp patch on the bottom and a freckling of black sesame seeds on top. The ratio of dough to meat is exact.

It is good to strategize a palate cleanser or two among your dishes, like a sweet-leaning <dish>cabbage salad</dish> and cucumbers that seem to have swallowed whole cloves of garlic. Both will leave you revived, if perhaps not quite ready for a near dessert of <dish>fried sticky rice</dish> under slashes of mayonnaise infused with orange juice.

Better to end with the <dish>demure pumpkin cakes</dish>, dusted with coconut and too light to be quite of this earth.
