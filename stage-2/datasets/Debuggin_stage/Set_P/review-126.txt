AS SoHo began to feel less like a New York neighborhood and more like a suburban shopping mall with
two lanes of taxis running down the middle, there was Savoy, a sane oasis on the quiet corner of
Prince and Crosby Streets. Even when years passed between visits, I felt better knowing Savoy was
there. Then   after 21 years, and the city felt a little smaller. Some of the sting was taken out
when Peter Hoffman, the chef and owner, promised to reincarnate the place in a new form along the
lines of his other restaurant, Back Forty. Opened on Avenue B in 2007,   for grass-fed burgers,
sustainably raised pork shanks and vegetables straight off the back of a farm truck. Back Forty West
isn’t a total clone. It’s more like a fraternal twin, sharing the logo and the look of the first
place, along with a few menu items and an overall philosophy. Mr. Hoffman’s move toward a casual
format that can be easily replicated is, of course, one that makes sense to more and more
restaurateurs. But this time around, the familiar story has a strange ending. Over the last month or
so, I’ve had a string of extremely pleasant meals at second-generation Back Forty West, and a
succession of sloppy, careless ones at the place it was modeled after. It’s as if Back Forty has
gone into a long, jealous sulk, like a family cat that responds to the arrival of a new baby by
hiding under the couch and scratching at anybody who gets too close. Unlike the original, Back Forty
West is open all day, an agreeable corner cafe that pours   by 8 a.m. and fries chicken to serve
over waffles at lunch. The neighborhood has embraced it, giving the place a confidence and sparkle
that take it well beyond the routine farm-to-table tropes. A filling bowl of <dish>Brazilian fisherman’s
stew</dish> loaded with squid and shellfish was bright green with cilantro and bracingly spicy. (Eat
locally, cook globally.) Squid played to even better effect in another dish, this one inspired by
Spain. Seared on a plancha until it was just done and not a moment longer, exactly the way squid has
to be cooked, it was served with <dish>smashed fingerlings</dish> and with butter dyed rusty orange by pimentón.
Butter, pepper, squid, potatoes: elemental and hard to argue with. Mr. Hoffman has installed a
smoker on the second floor of Back Forty West, near where the small bar used to be, and the
restaurant makes excellent, judicious use of it. A <dish>smoked chicken leg</dish> was so pink and juicy that a
friend called it chicken ham; pork ribs in a Carolina-style vinegar sauce might have been a little
more tender, but the low-key interplay of smoke and pig fat was just right. More than any one dish
he created, an early and steadfast loyalty to Greenmarket produce defined Mr. Hoffman as a chef. So
it’s the nicest kind of nonsurprise to find that Back Forty West handles vegetables with care and
imagination. Dressing asparagus spears with rhubarb vinaigrette struck me at first as seasonal
overkill, but it was in fact a lovely pairing. I also got a kick out of the restaurant’s tribute to
the Caesar  , with leaves of <dish>grilled kale</dish>, white anchovies and, in the role often played by stale
croutons, some irresistible fried chickpeas. The menu at Back Forty West is organized in a way I’ve
never seen before and hope not to see again: by eating utensil. If you have ever walked into a
restaurant thinking, “Boy, I don’t know if I should be trusted with a knife tonight,” this is the
place for you. Simply skip over the “Fork & Knife” section in favor of plain old “Fork,” or “Spoon &
Ladle” or “Hands.” Unmasking the main courses in this jumble takes bit of sleuthing, but it’s
obvious that the “Spoon” category is for desserts. A <dish>chocolate cake with hazelnuts</dish> was more gummy
than chocolaty, but I’d order the cookie plate again (and then make sure I kept all the bacon-fat
snickerdoodles for myself). And everyone seems to like the caramel   under an inch or two of
marshmallow, too. The same dessert is served at Back Forty, yet it isn’t the same at all. In SoHo,
the marshmallow is caramelized on top, giving it a tinge of bitterness that helps offset the
sweetness, and the pudding is very slightly salty. In the East Village, nothing stands in the way of
the sugar rush. One spoonful is more than enough. Direct comparisons between the two restaurants
were nearly always punishing to the older sibling. The <dish>grass-fed burger</dish> at Back Forty West, on a
soft potato roll, had plenty of character. The one at Back Forty, served on a crumbly sesame-seed
bun, had almost none. Back Forty West had the bright idea to grill pea pods with olive oil and
smoked sea salt and serve them whole; you pop the peas into your mouth like edamame. Back Forty had
the less bright idea to grill whole fava pods; you pop out the beans, then have to separate them
from their gray skins. Stranger still, the fava pods were plopped on top of some (quite good)
hummus. It’s hard to imagine this ungainly dish on the menu at Back Forty West, and not just because
you need your hands and a fork to eat it. This kind of inattention to detail was evident in every
meal I had at Back Forty. Grilled whole onions and chard leaves with their stems intact were so
undercooked, they were difficult to cut with a knife. Half the food, from <dish>French fries</dish> to a
yogurt-dill sauce, seemed to have been tossed into an open barrel of salt before serving, and food
that ought to have looked beautiful, like a beet salad, had been slammed carelessly down on the
plate, as if to punish it. Some diners look at the vanishing numbers of places like Savoy and mourn
the passing of the style of dining they represent. It’s no contradiction to share that sadness while
celebrating the rise of places like Back Forty West, which make fine local products into everyday
food. And Back Forty? At the moment, it is the cautionary tale, proving that simplicity isn’t so
simple, and that everyday food needs to be handled with care, every day.
