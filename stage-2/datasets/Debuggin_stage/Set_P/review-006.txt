 to eat,” the waiter half-whispered, bending slightly so the other diners wouldn’t hear. “The seaweed will lose its crispness.”
In my fingers rested the small bouquet of a temaki-style <dish>hand roll</dish>, nori furled around <dish>rice and ume</dish> (pickled plum). Obediently, I took a bite. The nori fractured, as if on cue.
It was the kind of attention to detail that you expect to find at one of New York’s temples of <dish>sushi</dish>, those hushed rooms where every gesture — from the presentation of the hot towel to the stoic nod of the sushi chef in his snowy uniform — is measured and balletic, every shimmer of fish to be approached on your knees.
It is not what you expect from a $47 omakase at a sushi bar with a neon “Open” sign in the window.
, which opened in August on the Upper East Side, is a surprise in a city with few options for sushi between the wincingly expensive and the suspiciously cheap. Its storefront window is cluttered with plants, a ceramic happy cat and an enormous white light fixture that calls to mind an exploded chrysanthemum. Taped to the inside is a page-long manifesto from the chef, Toshio Oguma, which gently “encourages” diners to eat his sushi with their fingers and to refrain from dunking it in soy sauce. (Heed him.)
Mr. Oguma worked at 
 in New York and in Napa, Calif., where he was executive sushi chef. At Tanoshi, he has stripped things down. The restaurant has only 10 seats, weathered-looking sawhorse stools arranged in an L around the counter. Space heaters hiss in corners. Mr. Oguma, a burly fellow, works silently in a T-shirt and a bandanna, with two helpers and a lone waiter who sidles behind diners to refill glasses of water. (There is no liquor license, alas, despite the words “sake bar” on the awning outside.)
Apart from a few appetizers, only sushi is on offer, and only omakase, chef’s choice. The price flutters according to the fish available each day, but Mr. Oguma says it never goes above $50 — this for 10 pieces of generously sized <dish>nigiri</dish> and 2 rolls, all prepared simply, with top-quality fish.
This might include salmon with a flicker of sansho pepper; seared Spanish <dish>mackerel</dish> with a shiso leaf peeking from underneath; <dish>ikura</dish> (<dish>salmon roe</dish>) mellowed in a bath of soy, mirin and sake, the brine balanced by yuzu and honey; and a scallop split open and laid out like an infinity sign, its texture wobbling between flesh and cream.
Farther afield is <dish>kani miso</dish>, which roughly translates as “crab brains” or “crab guts.” It is the juicy, buttery, greenish smush left inside the crab after the flesh is shucked out, here daubed under a tiger shrimp so you taste but don’t see it, a base note of murk.
The rice is seasoned with akazu, a vinegar made from sake lees, and Mr. Oguma concocts his own <dish>nikiri</dish>, a blend of soy, sake, mirin and dashi that is lightly brushed on the fish before serving. This is sushi in the classical mode, called <dish>Edomae</dish>, which originated as street food in early 19th-century Tokyo. At that time, lack of refrigeration required curing or marinating fish to preserve its texture. Thus, at Tanoshi you find fluke that has been pressed overnight between sheets of kombu, and <dish>hamachi</dish> that comes draped with a cherry-blossom leaf, which you are instructed to peel off and sniff (but not eat).
It is startling, after all this integrity, to be presented with a spicy <dish>tuna roll</dish>, as I was on a recent evening. It proved to be admirably subtle, the tuna fluffed up rather than bogged down by the infusion of Kewpie mayonnaise, sesame oil and tobanjan (fermented bean sauce).
Variety is limited at Tanoshi, and <dish>uni</dish> (<dish>sea urchin</dish>) isn’t always available. This makes sense, given the restaurant’s modest scale and commitment to low prices. As for toro, Mr. Oguma prefers leaner cuts of tuna, from bigeye instead of bluefin — partly because the latter is a dwindling species and partly because, he says disapprovingly, “It is outrageously expensive.”
It’s nice to know that the chef has your back.
