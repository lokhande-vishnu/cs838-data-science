“Do you know what the Brooklyn dog is?” the woman behind the Nathan’s counter says sternly. “It is not a regular dog.”
 It is early evening at 
, in Downtown Brooklyn. Eight and a half miles away, in hurricane-battered Coney Island, the original, nearly-century-old Nathan’s Famous lies 
, determined to reopen come spring. Here, the 
” — half hip-hop, half Gregorian chant — throbs faintly from the arena’s core, mournful and triumphant at once. The high-flying Los Angeles Clippers are in the house, and the Brooklyn Nets are about to make them kiss the ground.
Whatever the Brooklyn dog is, I want it.
It turns out to be a regular (that is, “jumbo”) Nathan’s <dish>hot dog</dish>, dressed up with a little help from some Brooklyn friends ($9.50). On it are nubs of blue cheese from Stinky Bklyn, in Cobble Hill; a celery slaw, overgrown with parsley, from Fatty ’Cue, which started out in Williamsburg; and a sauce in which heat knocks out sweet, from the wingmonger Buffalo Boss, whose home base is a few blocks over on Fulton Street. All this is barely contained by a potato hoagie from Baked in Brooklyn, which plies its trade across from Green-Wood Cemetery.
It is a fistful of borough and a beautiful mess, worth every spilled drop.
Set aside, for now, the 
 that surrounded the building of the arena. Barclays Center is trying to do right by its hometown, at least 
. Its spaceship-shiny silver lobby is lined with 12 permanent concessions — generic, hyper-lighted spaces of subway tile and Coca-Cola signage — that all make some claim to a Brooklyn bond.
So here is Paisanos Butcher Shop, an offshoot of the longtime family-run Paisanos Meat Market on Smith Street, offering sandwiches on dense ciabatta, packed with Angus tri-tip, chewy and respectable ($14), and a spiral of Italian <dish>sausage</dish>, pugnaciously salted, from the fourth-generation New York Sausage Company in Sunset Park ($11.75). L&B Spumoni Gardens, the venerable Bensonhurst pizzeria, is sadly represented by a Sicilian square slice ($6) that is spongy-bottomed and leaking sauce, a shameful lampoon of its better and cheaper forebear ($2.25, if you make the trek to 86th Street).
And then there is the new Brooklyn, bearded and ironic, dedicated to the handmade and the small batch, which is to say antithetical to the very idea of a sports arena. It is an uneasy juxtaposition. Note that the Brooklyn Bangers concession — stocked with artisanal sausages from the chef Saul Bolton, whose 
 holds one of the borough’s few Michelin stars — sells a Nathan’s hot dog alongside its own snappy rust-red <dish>brisket dog</dish> ($9.75) and a pallid but more belligerently spiced smoked white <dish>Cheddar bratwurst</dish> ($9.75). Bets are being hedged.
 But let there be no whining about how cooking for 18,000 people is hard. Perfection is attainable.
Witness the <dish>Cuban sandwich</dish> ($12.50) from Habana Outpost, the Fort Greene branch of Café Habana in NoLIta, a miraculous smashup of slow-roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese and pickles. Somehow the bread has retained body and crispness, the pork its juices.
Elsewhere on the highlight reel are <dish>tacos</dish> ($14) from Calexico, which began as a street cart in SoHo and now has restaurants in Gowanus and Greenpoint. Forgive the floppy flour <dish>tortillas</dish> and focus on the contents: beer-battered cod, the skin properly crunchy; a slaw with forthright spice; surprisingly fresh mango salsa; and a chipotle sauce hot and sly enough to make you blush.
 Still, the dish that turned heads as I carried it down the concourse was <dish>Calexico’s nachos</dish> ($10.75), an edifice evoking an ice-cream sundae, chips in mesmerized orbit around an immaculate guacamole sphere. The guacamole proved, alas, to have the temperature and texture of ice cream, whipped and chilled until all flavor was obliterated.
Among the less memorable offerings, Buffalo Boss’s boneless <dish>chicken wings</dish> ($10.75), organic and hormone free, are essentially just very good <dish>Chicken McNuggets</dish>, with a fervid sauce that skews too sweet. <dish>Chicken meatballs</dish> from the Midtown Manhattan power-lunch spot Fresco by Scotto — a seeming interloper, until you learn that the owner’s grandmother ran a poultry market in Brooklyn a century ago — are engulfed in tomato sauce, equally prosaic whether on <dish>brioche</dish> ($9.75) or <dish>gnudi</dish> (naked, $11.50).
You will wish you could forget the achingly sweet brisket at Fatty ’Cue, slopped on a <dish>banh mi roll</dish> ($13.75) and over <dish>mac and cheese</dish> ($10.25), whose potentially interesting blend of aged Cheddar, queso blanco, fontina and Gouda lies down and dies under the swamp of meat.
It is not always clear whom to blame: all 
 are partnerships between individual vendors and Levy Restaurants, which runs similar arena concessions across the country. Some vendors, like Brooklyn Bangers, supply premade food that is heated and finished on-site; others, like Calexico, have licensed Levy to produce their dishes from scratch in the arena’s kitchens. The people working the counters, who are generally amiable if not particularly efficient (beware the 15-minute wait for nachos), are Levy employees.
It is cheering to see, at each outlet, the “Made in Brooklyn” snack menu, including a milk chocolate bar studded with shards of <dish>pretzels and toffee</dish> ($6.50) from the Sunset Park confectioner Tumbador and <dish>potato chips</dish> ($4.25) from McClure’s Pickles, which does research and development in Williamsburg (but produces its goods in Detroit). Stinky Bklyn’s brown butter sea salt <dish>Rice Krispies treat</dish> ($6) is a stroke of midnight-munchies genius, sticky, salty-sweet and one of the best things you’ll eat all night. Missing from the roster but worth searching for is a pleasingly oozy <dish>dark chocolate and caramel bar</dish> ($6.50) from Nunu, in Downtown Brooklyn, which I stumbled on at a popcorn kiosk.
At halftime, the longest line stretches from Junior’s. (Tip: certain cake slices, $8.75 each, are also available at a free-standing stall directly opposite.) So what if the cakes are never as good as you remember? Have some respect. Some things in Brooklyn should never change. (Oh, 
! Where have you gone?)
Junior’s shares billing on its sign with the relative newcomer Blue Marble, a purveyor of organic ice cream made with dairy products from pasture-raised cows, with shops in Cobble Hill and Prospect Heights. Its approach to sugar is cautious, where Junior’s rushes in. Nevertheless, the two are thrown together in a “concrete” of Blue Marble soft-serve swirled with broken pieces of Junior’s cakes and cookies ($8.75).
It should be revolting, this concoction suspended somewhere between creamy and liquid, served in an imposing plastic cup with a bulbous top. It is divine. Old Brooklyn, new Brooklyn: this could be love.
