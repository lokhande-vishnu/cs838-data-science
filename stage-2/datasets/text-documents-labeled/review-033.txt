Usually, the opening of a cramped, brick-walled Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side signals nothing except more <dish>arugula salad</dish> and overpriced <dish>fusilli</dish>. But Tiella, which opened this summer, attempts to hoist the basic Manhattan-Italian menu to something approximating a modern urban trattoria.
The chef Giuseppe Castellano takes an old-school approach, getting everything possible from Italy, including <dish>stracciatella cheese</dish>, cured meats like <dish>speck</dish>  as well as <dish>moscardini</dish>, baby octopus. Many are deployed on the tiella menu. “<dish>Tiella</dish>” is a common Southern Italian term for roasting pan, which here means a tiny pizza ($11 to $12) with upscale toppings like prosciutto from San Daniele, bottarga (salty tuna roe) and, in one surprisingly delicious instance, thin shavings of foie gras.
Although the chef is originally from Naples (and also has a Neapolitan pizzeria, Gran Gusto, in Cambridge, Mass.), this menu is more a reflection of his global training in high-end hotels: a savory tangle of eggplant, smoked mozzarella, <dish>flat pasta</dish> and cherry tomatoes arrives in a crisp Parmesan “bowl” ($18), a miserly plate of <dish>salumi and cheese</dish> presents tiny bites spread on a white plate along with a doll-size spoon of fruit mostarda ($13). <dish>Chickpea fritters with cheese</dish>, figs and prosciutto sounds like a lavish rustic spread, but it turns out to be a cool, carefully stacked knife-and-fork appetizer ($11).
Much of this food has lovely flavor and interesting contrasts, but often lacks enough taste (which, in a $28 pair of <dish>lamb chops</dish>, is inexcusable) and even enough heat.
But it’s so pleasant to be served a <dish>salad</dish> with thoughtful garnishes like toasted pistachio nuts and fresh ricotta, or thin slices of apple and shaving of pecorino cheese ($10). The faint eggplant flavor in the <dish>sformatino</dish> is actually just enough. And when the potato crust on the <dish>Mediterranean orata</dish> ($24) is really well browned, its contrast with the lemony, emulsified sauce and fresh thyme leaves is just right.
A kitchen that spends this much time preparing fresh artichoke hearts  — for a <dish>simple pasta with sautéed shrimp</dish> ($21), and a more complex one with <dish>whole-wheat spaghetti, speck and wilted radicchio</dish> ($18)  —  is at least trying to prove itself. Also, the staff  tries hard to provide better than basic service, and the wine list is all Italian.
Tiella isn’t smooth enough to succeed as a high-end, four-course Italian restaurant, but for a snack of tiella, a bite of pasta and an excellent, house-made <dish>ricotta cake</dish> or <dish>tiramisu</dish> ($8), it’s welcome.
