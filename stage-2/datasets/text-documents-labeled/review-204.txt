FOUR cups of water, a cup of polenta and a lump of butter. Boil over medium heat for 10 minutes as
it bubbles like Satan’s private hot tub. Then bring down the flame as low as it goes. An hour later,
stir in salt, a spoonful of olive oil and three-quarters of a cup of grated cheese. That recipe
comes from Gabe Thompson, the chef of a  . I have studied and followed the directions, and I am
still having a hard time understanding how such a simple formula can yield a cornmeal mush so
satisfying. It is good enough to anchor a meal at L’Apicio, just as it anchors the menu, a single
sheet with a section right in the middle dedicated to  . The yellow grains are spread in a broad
swath on a long wooden dish, the spianatora. At first they feel almost weightless on your tongue,
like polenta foam, but gradually they surrender multiple waves of nutty melted Parmigiano-Reggiano.
Compelling as this <dish>polenta</dish> is, it would be merely a side dish if not for Mr. Thompson’s well-advised
habit of using polenta as a foundation for something more filling. This might be tightly rolled,
spicy little meatballs in a tomato sauce with fragments of bacon. Or it might be <dish>short ribs</dish> stewed
in red wine and covered with golden fried shallot rings. Or <dish>shiitake and oyster mushrooms</dish> roasted to
the brink of crunchiness, spiced with bits of pickled cherry peppers. The polenta dishes, along with
most of the   and appetizers, are handled so expertly that it almost doesn’t matter that L’Apicio’s
grasp of the main courses is much less steady. After eating from the  , you can be in such high
spirits that you don’t necessarily mind when the uncharismatic <dish>pork chop</dish> or dubious arctic char
shows up. You can even forgo them altogether. Uneven in ways that would capsize another restaurant,
L’Apicio can deliver a very enjoyable night out if you don’t ask too much of it. Mr. Thompson and
his primary business partner, Joe Campanale, have opened three other restaurants, starting with
Dell’anima and moving on to L’Artusi and the wine bar Anfora, that have a Greenwich Village
intimacy. Their dining rooms make the most of tight quarters to bring diners closer to one another,
or to the cooks working behind a chef’s counter. When the two took over the double-height ground
floor of a new condominium on East First Street, they left intimacy behind. You are greeted at the
door of L’Apicio by a squad of brightly smiling young women who guide you through a 160-seat space
that changes character each time it turns a corner, from the thumpa-thumpa lounge to the quieter
(but still not quiet) banquettes flanking the open kitchen, lighted like an operating room, to the
partly glassed-in space-within-the-space where tables are in sight of the wine cache. Even with
whitewashed brick walls and bare oak tables, L’Apicio can still feel like a trattoria airlifted into
a nightclub. It is not the place for a third date. But for nights when romance is not on the menu,
L’Apicio offers visible energy, smartly chosen wines and a self-assured American take on Italian
cuisine. Honed during his time at Del Posto, Mr. Thompson’s cooking is sometimes hearty and
sometimes gentle, but it is never retiring. His <dish>pasta</dish> is at least as admirable as his polenta, and
more varied, with about a dozen choices on any given night. Mr. Thompson takes <dish>ribollita</dish>, the
something-from-nothing Tuscan stew of cannellini beans and stale bread, and reconfigures it as a
sauce for orecchiette. He also seems to melt cauliflower into a warm liquid form, a filling for
half-moon <dish>ravioli</dish> that burst at first bite, like soup dumplings. Tender wide tagliatelle, yellow
with yolks, are tossed with a simple, lightly spicy ragù of <dish>salami</dish>. Imagine a sauce of chopped pork
sausage, color it red, add the twang of cured meat, and you have the idea. It’s a very fine one,
too. In theory, so was the combination of <dish>lamb Bolognese with green garganelli</dish>, but salt overran the
sauce. In this kitchen, salt often seems dissatisfied with its role as a supporting player, as if it
longed to be recognized as a main ingredient.
