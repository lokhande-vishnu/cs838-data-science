Tired of all things British yet? Probably not of British food, because odds are you haven’t tucked into a nice plate of <dish>bangers and mash</dish> lately, or a proper <dish>Victoria spongecake</dish> filled with raspberry jam.
But with well-turned dishes like those, as well as <dish>crumpets</dish> and <dish>kedgeree</dish> ($7 each), <dish>parsnip soup</dish> ($7) and <dish>meat pies</dish> ($18), Jones Wood Foundry may persuade New Yorkers to take English food seriously.
Open since February, Jones Wood Foundry feels antique but tastes fresh. It’s the very definition of a gastropub, where bar food with a bit of flair is even more important than drink.
It could use more British beers on tap rather than Belgian ones. And favorite English tipples like gin and brandy are unavailable; only beer, wine and some sprightly “wine cocktails” are.
The chef, Jason Hicks, who is English and has spent the last decade cooking French for the fashionable at nearby La Goulue and Orsay, is a man with a mission. He begins with an entire menu of toasts, traditional <dish>sandwiches</dish> deconstructed, with toppings as whimsical yet sublimely British as the hats worn at the royal wedding: shrimp, tarragon and celery; orange marmalade and Hudson Valley goat cheese; corned beef and piccalilli ($7, $9 and $13).
Mr. Hicks masters the <dish>steak and kidney pie</dish>, wrapping the meat in a burnished-brown suet crust and serving it whole; he does not even shy away from the dreaded <dish>Scotch egg</dish> ($9), and coats a just-boiled egg in sausage meat, then deep-fries it to form a thin, crackly outer crust.
The menu is overlarge, and thus not everything is well cooked: more vegetables should be on offer, and when the menu drifts off into trendiness, as with the <dish>chocolate-sea salt tart</dish>, it loses its reason for being. The treacle sauce on the sticky <dish>toffee pudding</dish> ($9) restores the balance.
The restaurant was clearly designed by wizards, who magicked a narrow bar and a warren of semi-subterranean rooms into a welcoming space, including a tuffet upholstered with a Union Jack on which to wait when the host can’t find your reservation.
Service is not as professional as could be, but the happy locals and assorted expat Britons who pack the place do not seem to mind.
