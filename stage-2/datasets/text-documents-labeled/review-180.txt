Le Bernardin
French
155 West 51st Street,

 has been the executive chef of Le Bernardin for 18 years, and people sometimes ask him if he gets
 tired of cooking fish. Clearly these people have never eaten at Le Bernardin. No other restaurant
 in the city makes the simple cooking of fish (and the fish at Le Bernardin is cooked simply, when
 it is cooked at all) seem so ripe with opportunities for excitement. Some of the thrills are the
 hushed kind, like the way black garlic, pomegranate and lime support the crisp skin and white flesh
 of sautéed black bass. Others are scene-stealers, as when a white slab of steamed halibut is slowly
 surrounded by a crimson pool of beet sauce that, with crème fraîche stirred in, will turn the
 delirious pink of summer borscht. A few are flat-out luxurious, like a small boulder of caviar
 nested inside a heap of sea urchin on a carpet of little gnocchi. I blinked my eyes a few times at
 the $70 supplement on top of the $125 set price for four courses at dinner. Then I decided not to
 worry, because a chance like this might not come along again. A year from now the <dish>sea urchin and
 caviar</dish>, along with almost everything else on a menu of nearly 40 items, may well have made way for
 a new crop of thrills. For a restaurant so determined to stay on top, keeping such a deep repertory
 and refreshing it so often would seem to be a risk. It is also, of course, one source of its
 enduring success. Le Bernardin’s four-star rating in The New York Times has been confirmed every
 time the restaurant has been assessed, from 1986, when it opened, through 2005, when   its most
 recent review. Why wait to say it: today I fall in line, happily, with my predecessors. Not that I
 am reviewing the same restaurant, exactly. Under the relentless guidance of Mr. Ripert and Maguy
 LeCoze, his partner in the business, Le Bernardin moves forward without a pause. To rest for a
 minute might mean growing old. Change, typically gradual, came in a rush last summer, when the
 interior was given a shake-up by the architecture firm Bentel & Bentel. The old dining room was
 always compared to a corporate boardroom, but for some reason its monumental scale and profusion of
 framed canvases in an antiquated style made me think of the atrium of a minor art museum. That’s
 all different now, starting with the art. Now, just one enormous painting of a brooding sea, “Deep
 Water No. 1” by Ran Ortner, looms over the space, imparting a sense of motion and immediacy. Wavy
 blades of twisted aluminum ripple like reeds along another wall. Opposite are shimmering, swaying
 curtains woven from vines and aluminum fibers. This room may never be sexy, exactly, but now it has
 a suggestive invitation in its eye. The downside of the redesign, however, is the removal of a good
 number of tables for two. Just as the restaurant has worked up a little romance, couples have a
 harder time getting reservations. The sleepy little bar was remodeled, too, and is now a sleek
 leather-and-steel lounge. Cocktails, when appropriate, come with a stainless-steel swizzle stick,
 not (please pound your fist on the bar along with me) a cheap plastic straw. The lounge is also
 something like Branson, Mo., for Le Bernardin’s greatest hits, bringing back from retirement
 classics like the irresistible <dish>smoked-salmon croque monsieur overflowing with caviar</dish>. The full menu
 is available, though I can’t imagine perching on a tuffet not much higher than a footstool to eat a
 $125 dinner. One French Connection cocktail and <dish>a brioche filled with warm truffled lobster</dish>, and
 I’d be ready to move along. Comfort, though, may not be the point. Simply having a lounge at all
 gives the entire restaurant a pulse that was missing before. The achievement of Bentel & Bentel’s
 design is that the interior now walks in step with Le Bernardin’s cuisine. Both are up-to-date,
 lively, intimate and playful. A corporate boardroom is no place for Laurie Jon Moran’s elegantly
 disassembled desserts, for instance. Mr. Moran’s plates are a bit busier than those of the last
 pastry chef, Michael Laiskonis, who left late last year, but the flavors quickly and agreeably
 reassemble themselves as you eat. And a museum is no place for the muscular sancocho sauce served
 with lacquered grouper, or more recently with striped bass. Inspired by the Puerto Rican stew, the
 sancocho is enveloping and warming, made from oxtails and chicken, with a low current of heat. The
 fish is treated like meat and likes it. Another attempt at the same treatment perplexed me: Dover
 sole in a red wine and cassis sauce the color of grape chewing gum. Out of more than two dozen I
 tasted, this was the only dish that didn’t come together for me. And at each meal just one minor
 detail struck me as not quite keeping up with the rest: the breads, which are outclassed at a
 number of places around town. Mr. Ripert has been stocking up on ingredients from Asia for years
 now, but somehow he makes the whole enterprise feel new. Sliced geoduck set down on a fluffy
 mousseline of smoked edamame and given a bath of wasabi and lime has obvious roots in Japan, yet
 doesn’t taste Japanese at all. The original impulse has been transformed. Like nearly all the
 savory dishes, this one depends upon the kitchen’s expert sauciers, especially Vincent Robinson,
 who has been on the job since 1985. Standing over his stockpots, Mr. Robinson has the control of
 Mariano Rivera on the mound. (Get well soon, Mr. Rivera.) When he makes a sauce of sweet pimentón
 for red snapper, the level of heat will be just perceptible; in a red wine and squid ink sauce for
 sepia, it will rise a bit higher and stop, right there. When he blends bergamot with grapefruit and
 other citrus for lobster, or jalapeño with lime for fluke sashimi, the nip of acidity will touch
 down precisely on   spot of your tongue, and nowhere else. Every time I went to Le Bernardin,
 somebody ordered a vintage Bordeaux, and the decanting apparatus would be trundled out. What on
 earth did those people order, I wondered, and did they ask Aldo Sohm for advice? Mr. Sohm, who
 holds the title chef sommelier, has studded his list with the required blockbusters, but he also
 has hidden oddities and discoveries to drink with raw <dish>salmon bathed in cardamom and ginger</dish>. He was
 joined on the floor at all times by at least two other sommeliers, silver tastevins swinging from
 their necks. They and other servers patrol the room like the Secret Service at a parade, on the
 lookout for the slight muscular shift indicating a guest is about to stand. One, two, three brisk
 steps, and someone is there to pull back the chair. There are slightly more women on the dining
 room staff these days, although men are still overrepresented as they are at other restaurants in
 this style. Ms. LeCoze and her maître d’hôtel, Ben Chekroun, are zealous about enforcing correct
 procedure, and woe to the novice who clatters dishes or forgets to look customers in the eye the
 minute they walk in the door. There is one other aspect of the service at Le Bernardin that sets
 the place apart from some of its peers. In spite of Mr. Ripert’s television appearances, in spite
 of the restaurant’s global acclaim, no one ever tried to let me know I was lucky to be there. But I
 was.
