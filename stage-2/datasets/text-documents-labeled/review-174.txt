Don’t be distracted by the tented stalls outside the 24-hour   in Flushing, Queens, with their
promises of baked eggs and potato pancakes shaped like hearts. There will be time for them. Go in,
past the stacks of 15-pound bags of rice and the clothing nook. (If you’ve reached the counter
selling deli manjoo, little spongecake fish with guts of sweet cream, you’ve gone too far.) Stop at
the sign that says   in Korean, with an English subtitle: Snack Corner. The name is literal. The
restaurant, begun 14 years ago as another tented stall, now occupies a proper corner. Orders are
placed at the kitchen, but food is delivered to the tables, packed efficiently back to back with
benches that fit three people to a side, provided they’re feeling friendly. Dishes fall under the
Korean category of bunsik, or snacks, though many are more substantial than snacks in the Western
definition, a reminder of how far we lag behind other cultures in this culinary genre.
<dish>Kimchi-and-beef dumplings</dish> arrive on plastic foam, under plastic wrap, as if from a 7-Eleven. They
are potent nevertheless, as is the similarly packaged <dish>soondae</dish>, a dark sausage of ground beef and
pork in a shiny casing that suggests the skin of a Goth balloon. There’s a hint of pork blood
seeping through, its moody tang offset by embedded grains of sticky rice. A <dish>platter of modumjeon</dish>,
described on the menu as assorted pancakes, turns out to be a selection of fish swaddled in
<dish>scrambled eggs</dish>, slabs of green pepper sandwiching ground beef, beef patties like homeless sliders
and rounds of zucchini, all lightly battered and fried. They seem to exhale oil, and are appallingly
delicious. They could be a distant cousin to <dish>tempura</dish>, as kimbap (rice and vegetables rolled inside
strips of seaweed) is to sushi. But here, the rice, seasoned with little more than salt and perilla
oil, lacks a vinegary-sweet bite and is merely refreshing. Trust your neighbors. On one visit, a
regular at the next table kindly shared her staples: <dish>kabocha porridge</dish>, the sweetness tempered by
pulverized sticky rice; rice cakes like elongated gnocchi, muddled with gochujang, soy and sugar;
and, most beloved, a skewered hot dog with an airy crust of panko, prefried and kept cool in a
refrigerated case, then recrisped in a wok to order — a corn dog from the fairy realm. Larger dishes
include doughy knife-cut noodles half-stained with carrot and beet juice, slashes of color in a pale
broth creamy with perilla seed (wild sesame). <dish>Budae-jigae</dish>, a soul-affirming stew suffused with
kimchi and mobbed by torn bacon, wedges of Spam and a hot dog cut into curling diagonals, comes on a
portable burner with a packet of instant ramen, to add or not, as you wish. (It doesn’t hurt.)
