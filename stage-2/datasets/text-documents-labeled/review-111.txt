An Choi

85 Orchard Street,

An Choi evokes the culinary thrill of Vietnamese streetside dining, minus the motorbike fumes. The
restaurant’s low-lit, alleylike design, inspired during a visit to Ho Chi Minh City by the owners
and brothers Tuan and Huy Bui, and the chef, Dennis Ngo, benefits greatly from a good-natured
suspension of disbelief. For starters, the sandwich “cart” at the front is wheel-less and immobile.
The stencils on the walls — common in the former Saigon, they’re phone numbers for Vietnamese
handymen — are unlikely to generate any business. The effect is less the exactitude of the nearby
Tenement Museum and more the camaraderie of a neighborhood hangout. An Choi is more serious about
its food, as you’ll discover once you tuck into a bowl of the noodle soup called pho (pronounced
fuh). Both versions, beef ($9.50) and chicken ($9) — which has an almost cultlike following in
Vietnam but is little celebrated in New York — develop an exceptional fragrance during their long
simmer. The add-ins include not only lime, Thai basil and jalapeño but also culantro, or “saw-leaf
herb,” cilantro’s stronger-scented but lesser-known cousin. The banh mi ($6.50 to $8) make a more
sparing impression; these sandwiches on baguettes seem to have too little meat. But fillings like
luxuriant crisp roast pig and engagingly chewy headcheese are top-notch and gratifying. Small plates
like cool salad rolls with shrimp and pork ($5), crispy crab and pork rolls ($5.50), and a cabbage
and   salad with prawn crackers ($6.50) are also prepared with precision. An Choi has no liquor
license or desserts; the best stand-in is Vietnamese coffee ($2.50). Available iced, it’s better
hot, dripped into the cup atop a layer of condensed milk. How you stir things up is up to you.
