Rosemary's
Italian
18 Greenwich Avenue ,

IN restaurants, as in high school, popularity can be a burden. Just ask the host at 
 who was cheerfully trying to marshal the wildly oversubscribed waiting list the other night. (The list has been oversubscribed pretty much continuously since the restaurant opened in June.)
In the kindest possible way, she tried to dissuade one member of my party from adding his name. Under strict orders from me, my emissary insisted, and finally succeeded. He was asked to come back in an hour.
My group of three passed the next 60 minutes very agreeably in a bar down the street, and we returned at the appointed time. Our host apologized and said there was a group lingering over drinks at the table she’d meant for us, so we would need to wait just a little longer.
And we did, standing out front, watching Villagers strut past the corner of West 10th Street and Greenwich Avenue. That was agreeable, too, for a while. But its delights were wearing thin 25 minutes later, when the host came out to say that the lingerers were still lingering. There was one table ready now, though. It was usually a two-top, she said with a wince, but since we’d been standing so long perhaps we’d like to take it?
She was doing her best, but the whole situation could have been avoided, thanks to a miraculous advance in technology.
Although it may sound like science fiction, a remarkable new device has the potential to change the way we communicate. It is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand yet powerful enough to enable you to place and receive calls wherever you happen to be — even inside a bar.
Yes, the “cellular telephone,” or “cellphone” for short, is real, and it is available now. One day, the owners of Rosemary’s may discover that this futuristic gadget can be a handy method of notifying customers when a table is ready. At the moment, they seem to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude.
There are reasons to put up with the list at the door, if not the restaurant’s technophobic method of handling it. First among them is the spirited cooking of Wade Moises, who learned to move gracefully around a scalding pot of spaghetti at Mario Batali’s finishing school. You can spot some of the headmaster’s knack for energetic flavors in Rosemary’s linguine, tossed with preserved lemon and threads of hot pickled chiles. I’ve never met a dish of 
 more deeply infused with the sunny brightness of citrus. Nearly as satisfying, but in a richer, porkier mode, was the chitarra alla carbonara with meaty strips of guanciale. But with just four <dish>pastas</dish> on the menu, there should be no room for disappointments like the gummy house-made cavatelli with starchy, crunchy peas.
Mr. Moises is adept at working vegetables and seafood into antipasti that bring your appetite to attention. With a spicy dressing of grated pecorino and pickled onions, he can make a treat out of slices of raw zucchini, typically as thrilling as an ice chip. The <dish>house-cured tuna</dish> is more voluptuous than <dish>cooked tuna</dish> has any right to be, and <dish>cold shrimp</dish> tossed with mint, jalapeño and ginger shows Mr. Moises knows when to color outside the lines.
At nearly every table, some wise person has ordered the porchettina, sawed-off columns of brined and roasted pork loin standing upright like the ruins of a Roman temple. The main-course-size minestra di stagione didn’t seem to tempt as many diners, but it should. On the night I tasted it, elbow macaroni shared the bowl with sugar snap peas, <dish>young turnips</dish>, <dish>asparagus</dish> as thin as a knitting needle, purple carrots and cherry 
, each vegetable cooked to its ideal point, all of them in a vegetable broth that was gentle but persuasive. The menu bills it as “the ultimate minestrone,” and the hyperbole is not far from the mark.
The cherry tomatoes in the soup, along with the ones in a very pretty tomato 
, were ripened in the Greenwich Village sun that beats down on a kitchen garden on the roof. The restaurant’s owner, Carlos Suarez, who also runs 
, seems rather proud of this. The words “Rooftop Farm” are printed on the menu, right below the name, and servers always mention the provenance of those tomatoes.
Most of the produce could have been procured at any farmers’ market, but the urban agrarian notion does seem to have provided a theme for the décor. The interiors firm Dekar Design flirts with rustic-Italian clichés without falling too hard for them. Parquet tables sit on parquet floors below exposed rafters; glass doors are thrown wide open in warm weather; potted plants are everywhere. The place has the feel of a trellised patio in some corner of Italy that’s heavily populated by Upper East Siders, the women wearing expensive rings, the men wearing even more expensive watches. I skulked through this slender crowd feeling like a beagle among greyhounds.
Many of those greyhounds look as if they could afford to pay far more than Rosemary’s asks: each <dish>vegetable antipasto</dish> is $5; the <dish>pastas</dish> are $14 or less. Given the quality, these are impressively low prices, and they provide another possible justification for the lines.
There are exceptions, though. One is the bistecca gran mela for two, a dry-aged strip steak served on the bone, for $80. It isn’t nearly as flavorful as the skirt steak, which provides a much more pronounced beefiness and, at $22, costs about half as much for a serving.
Rosemary’s wine list has a gimmick that seems to promise good deals: there are 40 wines, all for $40. That price feels comfortable until you find out how many of those wines can be picked up in stores for $12 or less. (If you want a reasonable return on your $40, try the 2010 Lia Vi Barbera d’Asti from Carussin; the 2009 Marzemino from Costaripa; or the 2007 Capitel Foscarino from Anselmi.)
If I felt some chagrin at paying $40 for the kinds of bottles that might be opened at an office party, most of it melted away under the influence of the summer breezes and the servers’ ready smiles. Just think how charming Rosemary’s could be if it took reservations or, failing that, if cellphones ever catch on.
