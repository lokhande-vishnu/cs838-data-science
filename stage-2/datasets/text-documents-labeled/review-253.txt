IF the <dish>meatball parmigiana</dish> hero were a Southern dish, scholars from Chapel Hill, N.C., to Tallahassee, Fla., would hold academic conferences every six months just to talk about it.
If it were a Florentine dish, the Four Seasons would have it on the menu for $95, or $55 without white truffles.
But it is an Italian-American dish. It is at home on Wooster Street in New Haven, Atwells Avenue in Providence and Salem Street in Boston. It cannot be ordered at any restaurant that uses a truffle shaver. The closest thing to an academic symposium in its honor would be the lectures on the Food Network given by Prof. Giada De Laurentiis.
Italian-American cuisine is not beloved by the arbiters of good taste, who celebrate 
 alla Milanese but ignore baked ziti, <dish>garlic bread</dish>, <dish>spaghetti</dish> and <dish>meatballs</dish> and <dish>lobster</dish> fra diavolo.
 the food columnist Josh Ozersky declared on 
 last year.
In that case, I would like somebody to explain why my mind keeps drifting back to the meatball parmigiana hero at Parm. Like most things at Parm, which opened on Mulberry Street in November, it is prepared by cooks wearing white paper hats and is set before you in a red plastic basket. And, like most things at Parm, it is completely faithful to your memories while being much, much better than you remembered.
At first, the <dish>sandwich</dish> exhibits nothing out of the ordinary. The tomato sauce, simple and summery, just seems to have been made by a good cook. The <dish>mozzarella</dish> and torn leaves of basil are fresh, which isn’t unheard of. The seeded roll is completely normal. The <dish>meatballs</dish> are not normal. For starters, they are not balls, they are patties. Anyone who has ever taken a bite of a meatball hero and watched one of the meatballs launch into orbit will recognize at once the significance of this deviation. Patties stay put.
Most sub-shop meatballs are as hard as a 15-minute <dish>egg</dish>. The patties at Parm are not. Your teeth fall right through them.
And when they do, you find something else that isn’t normal: the meat is juicy and rosy pink on the inside, the color of a perfectly cooked pork chop. The <dish>meatballs</dish>, made from veal, <dish>beef</dish> and sweet Italian sausage, are pink because they were braised at 180 degrees in a CVap low-temperature cooker for 40 minutes. They were braised at 180 degrees because Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, the chefs behind Parm, studied fancy-restaurant techniques under chefs like Andrew Carmellini, Mario Batali and Wylie Dufresne.
But the meatballs are sitting on a hero roll because Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone are Italian-Americans who, once they had a restaurant of their own, decided to cook what is a kind of 
 for them and for millions of other Americans, even those with no Italian ancestors.
This hybrid cuisine was created by immigrants who were, overwhelmingly, born in Southern Italy, at a time when the region was rural, overpopulated and desperately poor. More recently, when chefs and food writers studied authentic Italian food, they tended to travel to the wealthier north.
Italian-American cooking, a bastardized cuisine with roots in an out-of-fashion region, was doubly uncool. Mr. Carbone, in a phone interview, said that when he was working at Babbo, “The sense I got was that the food of Italy was legitimate food, and the food Rich and I grew up eating was this weird thing we shouldn’t talk about.”
Parm is essentially an expanded rendition of the lunch operation that the two chefs used to run at their first restaurant, Torrisi Italian Specialties, next door. (That restaurant now focuses all its energy on its prix fixe tasting menus.)
Parm makes former Torrisi lunch standards like heroes and a marvelous array of vegetable side dishes. But the menu has grown to include, for instance, baked clams. Briny and just-cooked beneath crumbs of sesame breadsticks, they are like the meatballs in that all their divergences from the original are improvements.
That’s the case with the fried calamari, too. Very small, very sweet and absolutely tender, they share their basket with two kinds of fried hot peppers that keep the squid from overstaying its welcome, as it sometimes can.
With other recipes, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone do not tweak the original. They throw it under the bus. You may know pizza knots as the cold, lumpish chew toys that let pizzerias unload their stale dough. The warm pizza knots at Parm levitate, held down in their basket, it seems, only by a veil of grated cheese.
The <dish>turkey sandwich</dish> at the old Torrisi persuaded many people, for the first time in their lives, to eat turkey more than once a year. It reappears at Parm (there would have been a riot had it not) served, as before, on a round semolina roll or on a hero. For the first time, it’s also on the menu as a platter, with a choice of baked ziti or 
 on the side.
The platters help Parm make its bid as a spot for dinner as well as for lunch. On that score, there is also a series of nightly specials, like a chopped steak on Tuesday to rival the one at Peter Luger and a zuppa di pesce on Friday.
But even a clever cocktail list doesn’t quite succeed in making Parm as enticing by night as it is by day. At all hours, tables are set with paper place mat menus dominated by <dish>sandwiches</dish>. The whole mood of the place, in fact, isn’t especially attuned to the sense of theater New Yorkers like their restaurants to provide after dark.
The old Torrisi managed to have it both ways. The shelves stocked with bags of pistachios and boxes of 
 looked utilitarian in the daylight and romantic when the votive candles were lighted. Parm has cartoony kitchen wallpaper and haphazard lighting that throws parts of the dining room into pools of shadow, and not the sexy kind.
Would a few candles stuck into straw-covered Chianti flasks be pushing the joke too far? Maybe, but Mr. Carbone and Mr. Torrisi aren’t afraid to embrace a good cliché. Recall those chefs and food writers telling us that pasta is its own course, not a side dish, when you’re enjoying a springy cube of baked ziti with your <dish>chicken</dish> francese at Parm.
Who cares what they do in Bologna? This is Mulberry Street.
