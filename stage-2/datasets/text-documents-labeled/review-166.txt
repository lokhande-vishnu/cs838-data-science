346 West 52nd Street,

DANJI is a wee little restaurant on West 52nd Street, done up in whitewashed brick and blond Ikea
stylings, naked bulbs, extension cords and a lot of wooden spoons artfully displayed, as if by David
Rockwell on a $200 budget. The crowds are fierce. There is a good reason. Hooni Kim, who opened   in
December as a new-style Korean take on a Japanese izakaya, is a terrific cook. Those who take the
time and care to explore his menu of both traditional and modernized Korean food will be rewarded.
Some stipulations before we eat.   is not a particularly comfortable restaurant. Customers perch on
stools along the bar or at high tables in the front of the room, or wedge into the few tables in
back. There are just 36 seats. It gets quite hot in the dining room, as at a crowded party in a
small apartment. Dinners proceed not as planned, leisurely affairs, but as fast-casual
turn-and-burns: you get small, shareable plates and some drinks, and then make room for the next set
of customers. You would not want to do business at Danji, unless your business involves knees
touching and the thrill of discovery. So stipulated. (A cold OB beer or glass of soju may help.) Now
slide your menu out of the drawer that hides just below the surface of each table. It is time to
graze. Danji works best if you buck the trend and eat a great deal as leisurely as you can, building
a tasting menu out of the tapas. (The plates run $6 to $18.) Start with a pairing off the
“traditional” list, of <dish>spicy whelk</dish>   and a small pile of <dish>buckwheat noodles</dish>. This ought to be
protected by the Marriage Equality Act. The <dish>tender little whelks</dish> are poached French-style with a
mirepoix cut through with lemongrass, garlic and ginger, and dressed in a sauce of  , a Korean hot
chile paste, that has been muted with rice vinegar and mirin, grated garlic and ginger. Across from
them sit fat noodles of the Japanese soba variety, glossy with that same hot sauce, along with honey
and soy, some watercress, slivered red onions, chives. They are each other’s best friends. Order
more noodles: <dish>japchae</dish>, glassy little numbers off a family reunion table in Seoul, sweet and salty
with sesame oil and soy, with hints of ginger and garlic to romance the accompanying julienne
vegetables and a small mound of barbecued beef. Have a crisp little <dish>pancake of scallions and Korean
peppers</dish>, or the seafood version if it is available as a special. You will benefit from some kimchi
as well, made for the restaurant by Mr. Kim’s mother-in-law. There is Napa cabbage, of course, among
other varieties: cucumber, of late, and ponytail radishes. Ignore for a moment the obvious sops to
Western palates and tapas-loving cocktail drinkers: the bulgogi sliders on the “modern” menu; the
“K.F.C.” fried-chicken wings; the <dish>kimchi</dish>,<dish> bacon and chorizo “paella”</dish> that reads like a midnight
Twitter posting from a chef in his cups. But only for a moment! Sliders may be a goofball trend like
cupcakes or Korean fried chicken. That doesn’t make them bad. (You can pass on Danji’s wings,
though: unremarkable, even a little pallid.) That paella is nice, too: hot and weird below a <dish>fried
Jidori hen egg</dish>, bright as the sun. And the <dish>bulgogi slider</dish>, crisp at its edges, turns out to be
packed with the sweet thrum of Asian pear and the salty hush of soy sauce, with smoky sesame oil and
the deep, steely taste of good beef. It provides excellent eating beneath its pickled cucumbers and
mesclun-amped scallion salsa, on a soft grilled bun. A <dish>pork-belly</dish> version does, too, caramelized and
fiery with gochujang and a finishing oil made from the seeds of hot peppers. Appetizers? Entrees?
All Danji’s dishes are small. One exception on the traditional menu is the <dish>poached sablefish</dish> with
daikon, which ought to be eaten with rice: the luscious fish and <dish>chopstick-tender daikon</dish> swimming in
a dark, lovely braise of Mr. Kim’s beloved soy, garlic, ginger and Korean red pepper, with a splash
of dashi and a fine julienne of ginger to lighten things up.
