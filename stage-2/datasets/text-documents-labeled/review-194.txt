Flames leap out of a sawed-off oil barrel at the 24-hour scrap-metal yard across the street. Power
lines droop, above them nothing but blue. It is practically big-sky country out here on the eastern
edge of Ridgewood, Queens, buildings slouching and sun smacking down. A sign says, “We do plastics,
scarf, stationery.” Walk a little farther, to the scuffed yellow storefront with a floral-plaid
ruffle in the window. Two red light bulbs flank the door. It is not where you would expect to find a
chef who once cooked at Eleven Madison Park and who is now making some of the best Vietnamese
street-style food in New York. The restaurant’s name, carved into a wooden oval out front, is
“bún-ker.” This is a pun on bún, Vietnamese vermicelli noodles, pronounced boon. But the chef, Jimmy
Tu, says you can just call it  . Before opening the restaurant, Mr. Tu trailed street vendors in
Vietnam, where his family is from. On the evidence of his <dish>suon nuong xa</dish> (pork tenderloin slapped
with lemon grass, shallots and ginger and grilled over charcoal, its fragrance working nearly as
hard as its flavor), he was an excellent student. Many a chef in this city has tried to recreate c<dish>ha
ca la Vong</dish>, the namesake dish of a legendary Hanoi hole in the wall. Mr. Tu’s version is perhaps the
simplest and the most true: salmon steeped in turmeric, ginger, fish sauce and fermented shrimp
paste, fried and strewn with scallions and quick-wilting dill. The menu does not trumpet the quality
of ingredients, but the salmon is organic, farmed in the sea off Iceland. The thrilling meats in the
Saigon Special <dish>banh mi</dish> (cha lua, smoky Vietnamese ham; five-spice pork pâté; and a sweet sausage of
pork shoulder, fish sauce and cinnamon) are all made in house. Bunker is a reminder that street food
does not have to be elevated to be great. You could ask nothing more of Mr. Tu’s <dish>banh xeo</dish>, a
rice-flour crepe gilded with turmeric, studded with shrimp and bacon and seared in a wok until it is
crispy on the bottom but still airy on top. (It is his mother’s recipe.) Occasionally Mr. Tu borrows
from other traditions, using <dish>Chinese egg roll</dish> wrappers instead of rice paper to give extra crunch to
the crab spring rolls, and pounding green papaya with a pestle, Thai style, so it softens and
absorbs more flavor. <dish>Ca ri ga</dish>, a curry sweetened by coconut milk, is served with a coarse roti,
bringing it closer in spirit to the Malaysian snack roti canai. Winter was the time for <dish>pho bo</dish>, the
labor-intensive Vietnamese beef noodle soup. For spring and summer, there is <dish>pho ga</dish>, made by
poaching a whole Bo Bo chicken (free range and freshly killed a day before delivery) in a broth of
roasted shallots and onion, cardamom, star anise and cinnamon. In the <dish>vegan pho</dish>, kelp, Chinese
preserved vegetable, salted cabbage, lotus roots, leeks and dried shiitakes do their best to equal
meat — and almost succeed. The dining room is makeshift, with a wall of bamboo poles trimmed with
thatch and T-shirts silk-screened with photos of banh mi and pho pinned to a clothesline. A ficus
leans from a rice-bag-covered pot. Customers fetch their own water from a cooler; chopsticks and
forks land on tables in a metal can. For now, the crowd is local: young Asian couples, black
families, guys with the aura of undercover cops who turn out to be off duty from the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority. The nearest subway stop is in Bushwick, some nine blocks southeast. Still,
even with the walk, Bunker is only a half-hour from Union Square, closer than Pok Pok and without
the wait. The space was originally dedicated to Mr. Tu’s boutique seafood supply company, Fish &
Ship, but flood damage from   forced him to put the business on hiatus. Short on cash, he and his
partners (including his younger brother, Jacky, who is also the sous-chef; a childhood skating
buddy, Roy Zapanta; and Mr. Zapanta’s cousin Shea Hsu) opened Bunker in January. It may be the only
restaurant in New York to open because of Sandy: a blessing at the end of the storm.
