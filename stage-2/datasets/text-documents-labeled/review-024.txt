“We take really good care of the cabbage,” the soft-spoken waiter said, as if that were the only explanation for why the people at my table couldn’t stop eating it, this handful of raw cabbage leaves with little adornment beyond salt, a gloss of sesame oil, dark threads of preserved seaweed and sesame seeds flung on top.
In Japan, he went on, when you go to an izakaya — an informal Japanese establishment, neither quite restaurant nor tavern, that treats eating as fortification for drinking — you order cabbage first, as a test. If the kitchen proves it can pull off such a simple dish, you stay and order more food.
“So,” he asked gently, “are you going to stay?” Well, yes.
 opened in October in the East Village. (It is nearly unGoogleable; it may as well be called Restaurant.) Out front is a replica of the sign of a defunct train station in Hokkaido, whose name, Kofuku, means happiness — that being what Izakaya is in the business of, according to the waiter, Yudai Kanayama, who also happens to be one of Izakaya’s owners.
A native of Sapporo, Mr. Kanayama, 24, came to the United States six years ago to study fashion and now sells vintage clothing at a Brooklyn flea market. On a recent evening he was wearing a faded Union Jack T-shirt and a shaggy triangle hat that everyone at my table wanted. (“She made it,” he said, pointing to his girlfriend and vintage-shop partner, Garam Celina Song, a young Korean woman with long blond hair who was in a corner buffing glasses.)
The narrow dining room is calm and white but not austere, thanks to mismatched chairs and a snaking shelf of sake bottles. Mr. Kanayama has an uncanny ability to match each diner with a sake that suits, whether it is one so plush on the tongue that it could be mistaken for white wine (Yamato Shizuku Yamahai), or one that blurs into flowery perfume, perhaps inspired by nature sounds played during the fermentation process (Nagaragawa Tenkawa).
But the chef, Dai Watanabe, also an owner, is not content to be an accompanist. The mission here may be comfort food, but there is a reverence to its making, even in the minor dishes, like a potent, if miniature, <dish>salad of burdock</dish>, clingy with miso mayonnaise, and banbanji, poached chicken slugged with a thick, unhurried sauce of nerigoma (toasted sesame paste), whose flavor suggests a more worldly peanut butter.
<dish>Cold tofu</dish> is so firm that it must be cut rather than scooped. Sluiced with dashi and soy, with feral curls of shiso and scallions, it earned from my dining companions the kind of adoration usually reserved for deliquescing meat. Another slab of tofu, marinated in miso for a week, turned flavor into assault, evoking Edam cheese.
Mr. Watanabe trained in Naples, Italy, and ran a pizzeria in Kawasaki City, outside Tokyo. Thus the mostly traditional menu includes the likes of <dish>fried potatoes</dish> with bright basil-pesto mayonnaise and <dish>fluke carpaccio</dish> stroked with olive oil and lemon, Italian-leaning dishes that still taste Japanese, more delicate in texture, with telltale winks of sweetness.
There is excellent <dish>fried chicken</dish>, but ignore it in favor of <dish>chicken nanban</dish>, which is fried chicken deified: soaked in sweet vinegar and engulfed in a tartar sauce that’s extra-voluptuous from a mashed-in hard-boiled egg. The flesh is almost creamy, impossibly juicy.
One of the best dishes is the forthrightly named <dish>beef guts stew</dish>, made with tucked-away parts underused in the Western world, which Mr. Kanayama illustrated by touching his throat, side and calf. All are rendered so tender you would never guess their origins. It’s deeper and wilder in flavor than the more familiar-tasting <dish>hayashi rice/dish>, a kind of homage to <dish>beef Bourguignon</dish>, with a French demi-glace of red wine and tomatoes.
The real test of the diner, however, is what the Japanese call <dish>spaghetti Napolitan</dish>, a classic of yoshuku, Japanese Western-style cuisine: pasta faintly red from a thin sauce of ketchup, soy and mirin, capped by a fried egg. It is a dish that comes from a language I don’t speak, and tastes at once alien and true. I couldn’t eat more than a few bites, but I’m glad that it exists.
