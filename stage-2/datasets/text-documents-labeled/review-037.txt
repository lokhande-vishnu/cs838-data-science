The name of the new artisanal bakery on Smith Street, Bien Cuit, translates from the French as “well done.” It signifies the way the best artisans believe all bread should be baked: with a dark brown crust to bring out the deep flavors of the grains. So the sign out front advertises the philosophy of the baker, Zachary Golper.
It’s one he delivers on in his <dish>baguette</dish> ($4), with its crisp crust and airy but still-chewy crumb. Mr. Golper uses a sourdough starter that adds tang, as well as a few more hours to its shelf life. The <dish>sunflower-rye</dish> ($5 for a half; $10 whole) uses light and dark rye flour and no caraway seeds, but still has that trademark tang. Neither needs anything more than a smear of butter — and maybe not even that.
Mr. Golper, who worked at the respected Pearl Bakery in Portland, Ore., and Le Bec-Fin in Philadelphia, bakes three times a day. It’s a too-rare and wonderful routine that means customers can get a truly fresh loaf in the morning, and even after work. Part of the midday bake is used for a small, excellent selection of sandwiches: a wonderful <dish>salami</dish> ($8) served with tomme and cornichons on a baguette, and the <dish>Athena</dish> ($7), rye spread with caramelized garlic and layered with zucchini and olives. It’s a vegetarian sandwich even carnivores will savor.
Bien Cuit’s décor is rustic, with exposed brick walls, a simple marble counter and a half-dozen or so unadorned tables. But decadence and fastidiousness is on display inside the pastry case. The <dish>almond-pear danish</dish> ($3.75) is a glossy square of mahogany pastry filled with pears, cooked in caramel and bourbon, that actually has the delicate flavor and distinctive texture of pears. The tarts have delicate pastry encasing intriguing combinations like lemon-grass-scented <dish>peaches</dish> and <dish>raspberries</dish> ($6), and cauliflower, <dish>Brie and lardons</dish> ($7). The <dish>croissants</dish> ($2.85 to $4.25) — plain, almond and artichoke-goat cheese on a recent visit — shatter, as croissants should, showering the plate with sizeable shards to be eaten with the last of your coffee.
Bien Cuit tends to cost more than your average bakery. But such is the price of having something eminently well done.
