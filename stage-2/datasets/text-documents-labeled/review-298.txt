It hardly seems the work of a culinary modernist once 
, this dish of four <dish>shrimp</dish>, simply grilled with olive oil, lemon and garlic, placidly curling as their kind have done for millenniums. Yet there it is, on the table at 
, Jesús Núñez’s casual new tapas spot in the West Village. Mr. Núñez, a native of Spain who ran three notable restaurants in Madrid, first appeared on the New York dining scene two years ago at the high-end Graffit (later renamed, less mellifluously, Gastroarte), where he disguised cauliflower purée as an <dish>egg</dish>, and squid-ink-blackened falafel as truffles in pulverized-olive “dirt.”
At Barraca, an <dish>egg</dish> is just an <dish>egg</dish>, which is to say, a wonder in itself. Barely <dish>fried eggs</dish> are broken up in a sticky hash of long-fingered potatoes, peppers, cheese and caramel-edged <dish>pork belly</dish>. A threesome of hard-boiled halves, plucked of their yolks, are piped high with tuna cream. They may be ennobled with laurels of salmon roe, tobiko and shards of chorizo, but they are still, at heart, deviled <dish>eggs</dish>.
For a chef known for trafficking in gelatinized wine and deconstructed sangria, this is back-to-roots analog cooking, the art-rock band unplugged, Dalí in a pastoral phase. What you see is what you get, and for the most part, the food is straightforwardly delicious: small overheated volcanoes of piquillo peppers, brimming with oxtail; browned, disheveled brussels sprouts flung with earthy fava beans and red flags of <dish>dry-cured serrano ham</dish>; a munificent heaping of duck confit on crisp flatbread, with an underlay of apple roasted to a pliant, mellow sweetness.
“You will have the croquetas,” a waiter admonished my table before disappearing with our menus. He was right: no one should miss these demicustards of béchamel suffused with <dish>chicken</dish> and mushroom and gilded to a prickly crispness.
Other dishes do not bear much scrutiny, like an oniony muddle of braised short ribs coalescing with mashed potatoes, or the mammoth yet oddly timorous meatballs in broth. But keep in mind that tapas are intended as supplement and spur to conversation. They are transient pleasures, to be enjoyed with a not entirely clear head. (Beehive vats of sangria, alchemized with the likes of sake, saffron, lavender and guindilla pepper, are on tap at the bar up front. They skew sweet. You might do better with a dark and velvety Rioja crianza.)
Paella is more epic in scale, offered in vast compartmentalized skillets so that you may sample up to three varieties at once. Only one lives up to its looks: paella de tierra, creamy and glutted with chicken, rabbit, <dish>pork belly</dish> and <dish>pork ribs</dish>. Other paellas suffered on a recent visit from erratic salting (too much and too little) and, confoundingly, had no crust — none of that glorious burned rice at the bottom to happily scrape up. A version with lobster, cooked in a terra-cotta cazuela so the rice stays wet, veered into soup, as it should.
The restaurant’s name is a nod to La Barraca, the itinerant theater troupe founded by 
 in 1930s Spain to bring traditional drama (in experimental, stylized incarnations) to rural audiences. Accordingly, the windowsills are stacked with vintage suitcases and a battered typewriter. Leather director’s chairs line the bar, in the shadow of a wagon-wheel chandelier. Ropes bundled around hooks lead mysteriously into the rafters, as if ready to drop a scrim.
When dessert arrives, you think for a moment that Mr. Núñez has relapsed into the avant-garde. For here is fried milk, liquid inexplicably turned cake. But this, too, has been done for generations: milk simmered with cinnamon and lemon zest, sugared and thickened with cornstarch, rolled in an egg wash and more cornstarch, then seared in a pan. It is rough-hewed, messy and magical, proof that you don’t need to show off to surprise.
