Roman's

Roman’s used to be Bonita, a small, neat Mexican place in Fort Greene where children ate rice and beans, regular adults ate tacos and extra-credit adults ate pig’s head quesadilla.
Then the owners, who also run Diner and Marlow & Sons in Williamsburg, turned it into Roman’s. Roman’s is more serious and grown-up, with a marble bar and votive candles galore, so it has mostly shed the children. Neighbors are starting to take to the place, but it isn’t always easy.
The menu is like a jigsaw puzzle found in a beach cottage: you drive yourself crazy before you figure out some pieces are missing. There are starters, pastas and mains — about three of each, which makes it hard for a table of two or more to assemble a meal without redundant ordering. Portions run the gamut from idiosyncratic to infuriating. Three courses, the dose that waiters recommend, is often too much, but two is not enough, especially if one is <dish>pasta</dish>, which Roman’s parcels out like pixie wings.
Roman’s seem to have an Italian model in mind, but it hasn’t provided enough choices to make that model work. It might be easier for everyone if it just went with a set menu: three fixed courses, take it or leave it. Freed from Roman’s most maddening aspect, diners could focus on its most rewarding: the clean, almost monastically pure cooking.
Raving about dishes that may never be offered again borders on sadism, but for examples of what the kitchen does well, consider a small plate of <dish>sautéed bay scallops</dish> not-quite dressed in olive oil, sea salt and balsamic vinegar ($10) or a bowl of <dish>fresh tagliatelle</dish> in a textbook ragù bolognese($10).
