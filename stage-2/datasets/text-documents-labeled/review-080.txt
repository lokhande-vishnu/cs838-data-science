Prime & Beyond
Korean, Steak Houses

Is New York ready for a serious steakhouse without hash browns or shrimp cocktail? Kyu and Kevin Lee, Korean-American brothers who opened Prime & Beyond in the East Village this summer, believe so.  Like the original Prime & Beyond in Fort Lee, N.J., the Manhattan restaurant serves wonderful <dish>beef</dish>, all of it prime, at below-market prices —  alongside a few excellent Korean and Japanese side dishes.
The Lees are not interested in a copycat American steakhouse, or even a Korean one.  In 2003, with no particular food experience (but a belief that there was money to be made in meat), Kyu Lee opened a butcher shop in Fort Lee.  They didn’t realize that the competition for top-quality meat would be stiff.  “They weren’t used to seeing Asians,” Kevin said of the wholesalers at Hunts Point in the Bronx. 
The Lees persisted, built a clientele and opened a restaurant next door to the shop in 2007.  Now, the brothers are allowed to choose their carcasses at Master Purveyors, alongside the buyers for Peter Luger and Keens.
Mainly, they serve <dish>steak</dish>, some of it dry-aged (for marbled cuts that ripen over time, like T-bone, and porterhouse for two) and some of it wet-aged (for lean cuts that can use some juice).  The <dish>wet-aged filet mignon</dish> ($35, with 
), normally dull and tidy, bursts with juice and flavor. A few cuts are available in both dry- and wet-aged versions, which makes for interesting table talk among the meatheads.  The kitchen is open, meaning that the sights and smells of blistering fat are part of the view, and the truly bloodthirsty can descend to the basement to view the dry-aging process from behind glass.  
There are piles of Korean-style meat, like spicy, succulent <dish>pork slices</dish> ($18), <dish>beef short ribs</dish> ($20) and a deeply flavored bowl of what may be the only prime-grade <dish>oxtail soup</dish> ($18) in the city.  The <dish>burger</dish>, also prime, is magnificent, but not best appreciated on a bun.  Have it medium-rare over rice, with a runny <dish>fried egg</dish> ($17) and kimchi.
“No fish, no chicken,” Kevin Lee said.  “I want this to be clear.”  For diversity, try the dry-aged <dish>lamb chops</dish>.  
Vegetables will cost you: <dish>plain grilled asparagus</dish> is $7, or about a dollar a spear; thick, lightly roasted and delicious <dish>king oyster mushrooms</dish> are $10.  For those who crave simplicity with steak, these are excellent.  To wallow in creamed spinach and Cheddar popovers, or in thousand-dollar California cabernet, go elsewhere: the most expensive wine on the 14-bottle list is $75.  
The Korean dishes include pa muchim, <dish>scallion salad</dish> dressed with light sesame oil and rice vinegar; delicately tangy kimchi made by the Lees’ mother, Ok Joon, who cooks full time at the Fort Lee restaurant; and flat, <dish>crisp steak fries</dish> with floury insides. (All are $5).  The desserts are forgettable.
The room is sleek, brightly lighted and modern, barely decorated with chalkboard drawings of meat cuts.  Service is quick and friendly, attentive but offhand.  “We can’t go backward,” said one waiter regretfully, acknowledging an overcooked burger.  There seemed no immediate answer to this piece of wisdom. “I could get it cooked more, but it can’t be cooked less,” he said.
