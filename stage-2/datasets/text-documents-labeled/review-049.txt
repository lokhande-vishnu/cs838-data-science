Whitehall Bar and Kitchen
English
19 Greenwich Avenue,

The signature cocktails at Whitehall are numbered, suggesting severity. No. 1 ($10), though, tastes like a lovely cup of tea. Made from assam-leaf-infused vodka, orange marmalade and just enough milk to lend a cozy unctuousness, it’s a marvelous simulacrum. You can almost see the chipped Spode pot. To complete the illusion, a finger of shortbread is balanced on top.
“Some people like to dunk it,” a server advises. Then she flits off to explain Gentleman’s Relish to a table of venture capitalists.
Whitehall is British, more or less, and rather a scene. Since opening in late October, it has bustled with a fashion-y crowd downing <dish>oysters</dish> and organic New Zealand wine. It’s run by the team behind Highlands and Mary Queen of Scots, purveyors of Scottish swank. Here, they’ve moved to the other end of the isle. Tube-station tiling and park bench banquettes signal London.
The gin-leaning cocktail list includes new creations like No. 4 ($12) — pleasantly medicinal with ginger and yellow Chartreuse — and well-made standards. An icy-perfect Vesper ($11), James Bond’s tipple, captures the slightly racy, nostalgic mood. So do the clever snacks by the Australian-born chef Chris Rendell.
That mysterious Gentleman’s Relish, anchovy butter, adds a nice bit of funk to a dish of <dish>pan-roasted squid and sausage</dish> ($12). <dish>Shrimp “cocktail”</dish> ($13) is a small pile of flash-fried unpeeled shrimp, served with Marie Rose sauce, a 1970s British luncheon throwback. It’s great. In the same retro sprit, Mr. Rendell serves <dish>oysters Kilpatrick</dish> ($20), filled with Worcestershire and smoky bacon: an Olivia Newton-John-era dish beloved by aspirational Aussie hostesses. Perhaps it should have stayed in the past — good oysters get lost in the (admittedly tasty) murk.
<dish>Mushy pea fritters, served with minted yogurt</dish> ($6), however, do a wonderful trick, turning chip-shop stodge into something vaguely exotic. Brilliant, as they say across the pond. Cheeky, even.
