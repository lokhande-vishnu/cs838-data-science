FOR all the restaurants in New York City claiming the name “bistro,” it is rare to find one with the
most crucial ingredient. It’s not duck confit; it’s a dining room where everyone is welcomed and
waited on by the owner, who may also be (or be married to) the chef. So it is a shock to find just
that in the Bronx, not usually a repository of authentic French cuisine. In fact, since Stephane
Kane opened   in 2011 with his wife and co-owner, Maria Caruso, he has claimed that it is the only
French restaurant in the borough. It is certainly the only one on  , an anomalous spit of land that
combines elements of a 17th-century fishing village, a working-class beach town and a quiet suburb.
City Island is home to fewer than 5,000 New Yorkers, but it is a popular summer destination for
from the rest of the city. Usually, they come for <dish>fried clams</dish> and <dish>garlic bread</dish> — not for French
food, except for the fries that families eating outdoors at the Crab Shanty toss up to the predatory
sea gulls. At night, City Island is left to its residents, who have welcomed Bistro SK as if
positively starved for <dish>coq au vin</dish> ($19) and <dish>bavette</dish> ($21), hanger steak with red wine-shallot sauce.
Ms. Caruso’s local roots (she has lived in the Bronx since age 2) make up for the definitively
French qualities of Mr. Kane, who is sufficiently Gallic to instruct visiting children to sit up and
put their napkins on their laps. He has worked at some of the city’s temples of French gastronomy,
like Daniel, but grew up streetwise in Metz in Alsace-Lorraine, and left home when he was 13. (It
did not make life easier, during the 1970s, that his father was Senegalese and his mother French.)
Now he watches closely over the 35-seat restaurant, chatting with new customers and his regulars,
who are mostly families and couples. In between restocking the bread baskets and opening wine
bottles, he manages the trick — also rare in New York City — of being attentive without hovering,
friendly but not familiar. For off-islanders, professional service and fairly priced good food are
the reasons to make the trip: there is no culinary revolution under way at Bistro SK. In fact, it
has the kind of greatest-hits menu hardly seen in France these days: <dish>onion soup gratinée</dish> ($9),
<dish>frisée aux lardons</dish> ($10) and an excellent m<dish>oules marinières with fries</dish> ($11/$18), properly served
with a small boat of homemade mayonnaise. The desserts ($8) are equally reactionary and well done:
<dish>crème brûlée</dish> with the right thick topping of hard caramel, a basic chocolate mousse surprisingly
improved by a topping of toasted walnuts, and a floating island that is both textbook and delicious.
Some other bistro standards, whether classic or modern, verge on boring: <dish>tuna tartare</dish> ($12), <dish>beet
and endive salad with blue cheese</dish> ($9), <dish>lamb shank with white beans</dish> ($24), and <dish>duck confit with duck
fat fried potatoes</dish> ($21) could all use a little more spark. In deference to American ways, there is
a salad with <dish>grilled chicken</dish>, with a good sesame dressing ($14); a <dish>cheeseburger</dish> ($12); and even a
children’s menu. The menu emphatically does not follow the seasons, but some of the best dishes are
the specials, which change daily according to the local catch and the weather: nicely browned
fillets of trout in the summer, a thick pork chop with mustard sauce as winter approached. Even
though Bistro SK lacks the views of Long Island Sound that make nearby restaurants popular, it fills
up on weekend nights. The bar, bright with Eiffel Tower trinkets and twinkly lights, is popular with
locals, even though it lacks the flat-screen televisions and draft beer of its neighbors. It is
hardly a luxurious restaurant: chairs are hard and the space is narrow, providing too many seats
with a view of the bathroom. But it is an honest attempt at recreating an old-school French bistro,
and its coziness embraces even first-timers.
