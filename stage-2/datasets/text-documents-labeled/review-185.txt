EVERYTHING is new in New York save for that which is old, and when something goes from one to the
other, the transition can be sudden and surprising: a wet foal that’s suddenly distinguished and
large, a horse that rides with the weight of history on its back. Ten years ago, for instance, Strip
House wasn’t a venerable steakhouse in Greenwich Village, with familiar cheesecake pictures on the
scarlet flocked walls and 40-year-old men drinking Cutty at the bar, reminiscing about 30th
birthdays spent there, how they’d stolen the racy Frette napkins off their table and taken the
marrow bones the restaurant used to serve along with the steaks home to their dogs, now dead. They’d
done the same thing at 32, at 36. (Maybe at 39, too? Such a history to the place!) No, in 2000,
Strip House was just new and strange, a kind of simulacrum of a bordello restaurant in a city that
might have been anywhere in America. All that was aged about it were the steaks and the sepia-toned
portraits of forgotten opera stars on the wall, left over from when Strip House was Asti, an Italian
joint made famous by its role in the Tom Hanks vehicle “Big.” It was a dining room for the green.
William Grimes, in a review for The New York Times that year, wrote that Strip House wasn’t so much
a steakhouse as “a catalog of hip references to the idea of a steakhouse.” He awarded the restaurant
one star. Now it deserves two. Age has given David Rockwell’s design for the room a kind of
gravitas, and with it the restaurant has gained some of the clubby appeal you used to be able to
find at places like Gino,  on Lexington Avenue, which has a similar layout, or in the bar room at
“21.” (As at “21,” there is great fun to be had in snooping about the place. In addition to
portraits of Viennese strippers, torch singers and ancient celebrities on the walls, there is a
signed portrait of Thurgood Marshall near the bar.) The service is professional and attentive, with
none of the gruff theatricality that attends tables at Sparks or Smith & Wollensky. The wine list is
comprehensive and interesting, with reds to surprise palates and draw the attention of
expense-account auditors alike. And the food is generally marvelous, the steak often superb. Strip
House belongs to Peter and Penny Glazier, the restaurant tycoons who own Michael Jordan’s in Grand
Central Terminal, as well as mimeographed Strip Houses in Las Vegas and Houston, in Florida and New
Jersey. The Glaziers buy a lot of meat. They use the leverage to secure excellent product. John
Schenk, the executive chef at Strip House since 2006, makes sure of its use. He has his line cooks
grill the steaks  tight and well, with a thick crust of salt and pepper that highlights the deep
flavor of the beef. (The marrow bones may be gone, but a sprig of rosemary, stuck into a bulb of
roasted garlic, still accompanies each steak.) Best is the New York strip, served on the bone and
out of the short loin of the cow, 20 ounces of muscle that make up the bottom part of a porterhouse.
The strip is the restaurant’s <dish>signature steak</dish>: beefy and rich, tender, with the kind of giant,
mineral-tinged flavor that puts elbows on the table and calls as much for martinis as for wine.
Paired with a colossal ovoid of potatoes fried in goose fat, and a vat of creamed spinach made chic
with black truffles, <dish>Strip House’s strip</dish> is on its way to becoming an iconic New York City meal,
perhaps one day to take a place near the pan roast at the Oyster Bar, or the Grand Marnier shrimp at
Shun Lee. There are other cuts available: <dish>a catcher’s mitt of rib-eye</dish>, with perhaps a little too
much fat for the Michelin inspector; a wide  porterhouse served in the Peter Luger style, with
butter sauce; and a few versions of <dish>filet mignon</dish>, including a special that comes grilled on the
bone. These last do as filet mignon generally does. They disappoint. (If someone insists on the
filet, insist on a boat of Mr. Schenk’s excellent béarnaise sauce to go with it.) But a <dish>veal chop</dish>
will work for anyone interested in a glorious reminder why we love grilled veal: it’s deeply sweet
and tender beneath its crust, pale and pink, trembling good. And a rack of pungent, delicately
fatted lamb in a mustardy bread-crumb crust, served with a soft white-bean stew, makes a strong case
for inclusion on any table. It’s grassy and rich, not at all gamy, with beans that melt in their
sauce. And while the goose-fat potatoes and truffled creamed spinach represent the top of the
side-dish heap, it may also be worth considering a cone of golden fries; or a plate of crisp,
gigantic <dish>onion rings</dish>; or even a baked potato with bacon, Cheddar, chives and sour cream that’s
straight out of the American past.  <dish>Steamed broccoli</dish>? It sits on the table like a prude. Douse it in
béarnaise immediately. There is more than steak and potatoes on the menu, of course. A terrific <dish>bibb
lettuce salad</dish> with Stilton vinaigrette sits on the appetizer list beside  roasted bacon with arugula
and Russian dressing, a sorority girl in her first low-cut blouse, across a table from a trader in
broadcloth and loosened tie. Both are great. There is an irreproachable <dish>shrimp cocktail</dish>, a better
<dish>crab cake</dish>, with bright corn salsa and a <dish>spicy rémoulade</dish>, even a beet salad that’s worth a strong
look. (Avoid the house-made jerky, leathery and wan.) Yellowfin tuna with a green peppercorn sauce
and a kind of <dish>sushi-bar vegetable roll</dish> is ruddy and rich, well cooked beneath a coating of sesame
seeds. But pan-seared red snapper in a basil sauce, with a nice run of artichokes, pancetta and
fingerlings beneath it, isn’t going to win the year’s sustainable-seafood award. For that, it’s
still deeply flavorful, flaky and clean. You can always have lobster, fat beneath its hard shell, an
Atlantic success story, a mess worth making. Desserts are of course available, but really there is
but one to order, and for the table: a 24-layer <dish>chocolate cake</dish> the size of a stunt gift in the
Neiman Marcus catalog. It’s neatly covered in ganache, fantastically rich and good, the size of a
house cat formed into a triangle. Chase your portion with an espresso or tumbler of bourbon, maybe a
glass of milk. It might make you feel younger
