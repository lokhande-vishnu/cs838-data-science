BOBO was like the new kid who showed up on the first day of school in perfectly torn jeans, with a
perfectly cocked hip and perfect confidence that the right pose and prettiness were all it took to
get by. Bobo was aloof. It didn’t bother with a sign outside its subterranean front door, an easily
overlooked portal to two floors of a century-old town house with exposed brick, an antique piano and
hexagonal bookshelves filled with Bellow and bric-a-brac. Admirers would find their way. Insiders
would get the word. Bobo was self-impressed. How else to interpret its affected groaner of a name?
If you asked what it meant, you were told that it was shorthand for the confluence of bohemian
spirit and bourgeois success. And you winced, especially if you learned as well that the
restaurant’s owner, Carlos Suarez, had dubbed its energy-efficient, recycling-sensitive ethos
“coco,” for “collective conscious.” With food that yo-yoed between so-so and no-no, Bobo wasn’t
earning the right to this much semantic cuteness, which it seemed to be bungling to boot. Conscious
or  ? You had to wonder. And you had to pause when the phone was answered “Bobo residence,” as it
often was, and debate whether to make a reservation or, in the spirit of playing along, ask for Mrs.
Bobo, making clear that Mr. Bobo would do in a pinch. But beneath all that nonsense, it turned out,
was a restaurant that cared about more than buzz and size 0 regulars  — that wanted, and was willing
to work for, respect. Before it was four months old, Mr. Suarez dismissed his first, poorly reviewed
executive chef and got a new one. Seven months after that, he nudged that new chef aside to make
room for a culinary star in Boston who was willing to make a move to Manhattan. That star, Patrick
Connolly, from the restaurant Radius, has been in charge since mid-August. And he’s given Bobo
something more than its looks to be vain about. In fact a few of his dishes  —  his appetizers, at
least  — manage to steal attention from the votive candles lining the dark, narrow  staircase up to
the main dining room and that room’s droopy lighting fixtures, which bring to mind gargantuan glass
. The Maine crab, for example. Mr. Connolly compensates for how wispy and insubstantial strands of
sweet, delicate <dish>crab meat</dish> can be by stacking them into what looks like a cupcake,  and more or less
icing it with cashew butter, which does the unctuous work that another chef might assign, less
imaginatively, to avocado. Fried capers cut the richness. Avocado makes its predictable appearance
with raw ruby-colored tuna, but even in this safest of starters Mr. Connolly shows some creativity.
Each wedge of <dish>ahi tuna</dish> is on its own thick, crisp cucumber slice, the avocado a subtle purée between
them. On top of the tuna, snapping everything to life, are sprigs of cilantro. The pork belly also
stands out, another appetizer staple given a treatment that’s not routine. The belly, cut into
strips, is interlaced with similar size strips of crackling, which just barely crest the surface of
a lemon grass broth. With its citrusy spark, the broth makes an appealing foil for the fatty pork.
All of these dishes demonstrate Mr. Connolly’s fine sense of balance when it comes to flavors and
textures. The capers, cracklings and cucumbers all take what could approximate baby food and require
you to bring some teeth to the party. And the tuna and pork appetizers speak to Mr. Connolly’s
fondness for Asian inflections, an affinity that distinguishes his Bobo from the Bobo of his
predecessors, who gave it a more steadfastly Mediterranean personality. But what carries over from
previous incarnations of Bobo is a sense of caution, a feeling that the menu is driven too much by
what diners on automatic pilot expect and too little by real inspiration. <dish>Sea trout</dish> (standing in for
salmon), <dish>monkfish</dish>, <dish>chicken breast</dish>, a <dish>pork chop</dish>, a <dish>rib-eye</dish>: the array of entrees is entirely
unsurprising. The cooking during my visits was often impressive, epitomized by the tenderness of
that <dish>chicken breast</dish>  — served in thick petals with artichokes, mushrooms and a garlic and parsley
sauce  — and by the crunchy-gooey contrast between the outside and inside of breaded, <dish>deep-fried
veal sweetbreads</dish>, a preparation reminiscent of the restaurant Prune’s but even better. But <dish>seared
daurade</dish>, served with ginger butter in a miso consommé, was slightly overdone, as was the pork chop
one of the two times I tried it. And a gnocchi entree, arrestingly large in portion, was arrestingly
bland in taste, its claims of sage and Parmesan notwithstanding. Bobo had some consistency problems
that didn’t go away with dessert. One night the   mousse was cold and hard, as if it were a
semifreddo that had been mislabeled on the menu.
