IF you judge  by appearances, New Wonjo Restaurant is the same Koreatown standby it was when it was just plain Wonjo. It’s still open 24 hours a day, and the menu is still the size of a ledger. As always, runners thread through the busy upstairs dining room carrying braziers of glowing coals for the in-table grills in what must be one of the most unsafe, if exhilarating, opening acts to a meal you’ll find in Midtown.
The new owners, Steve and Christina Jang,  didn’t make jarring changes after taking over in March. But they renovated the kitchen, hired a new staff and installed a nearly silent venting system from South Korea (you can hold conversations when the fans over the grills are on).
It’s when you start to eat that New Wonjo Restaurant lives up to its rejuvenated billing. There’s a new energy in the kitchen, and you can taste it on the plate.
It starts with the lively and fresh banchan, the 6 to 12 plates of pickled, steamed and cured snacks that appear, unbidden, after you order. Standards like kimchi, sweet radish and <dish>broiled fish</dish> are joined by spicy shisho leaves, or fermented black beans with peanuts, or tiny dried fish with roasted walnuts.
This kind of food invites drinking. So does the kimchi jun ($15.95), a <dish>pancake</dish> expertly fried so that the crust is crisp and the interior is silky. Skip the vodka-like soju for the Edong  makgulli  ($15.95 for one liter), a milky, slightly effervescent <dish>rice</dish> wine ladled into cups from a plastic crock that does a pretty good job of looking as if it’s made of stone. The <dish>rice</dish>dish> wine is a little sweet and pleasantly funky, and even if it’s not to everybody’s liking, it goes with almost all the food.
That agility is impressive if you consider that there are more than 100 dishes at New Wonjo, not counting what’s at the sushi bar. So much choice is paralyzing.
No wonder most stick to familiar favorites at a restaurant like this, the bibimbap or the barbecue. It doesn’t help that the adventurous aren’t always rewarded. On one visit, the bu dae jun gol ($37.95), an enormous stew of spicy <dish>sausage</dish>, kimchi and vegetables that the menu says serves two but could easily feed three, tasted like hot dogs simmered in Campbell’s <dish>tomato soup</dish>.
But it would be a shame to miss out on the galbi tang ($13.95), a short-rib stew with a clear broth that’s so pure and meaty it should be taught in cooking school. The bowl arrives holding little more than stock, slices of beef and bones, a classic dish at its most elemental.
The spicy ox bone stew ($11.95) is more challenging but no less rewarding. Use your chopsticks to pick off tender meat from bones sitting in the soup. This already rich dish becomes a heavy meal once you get to the cubes of blood in the bottom of the bowl.
Not everything is so menacing. The whole young <dish>chicken soup</dish> with ginseng and <dish>rice</dish> ($18.95) is exactly that, an entire poached pullet, in broth with a side of sea salt. It’s delicate and satisfying, what you’ll crave when you feel a cold coming on.
Now that bulgogi is a crossover hit, the thin, slightly sweet slices of marinated rib-eye, tender and crinkled, feel like a safe bet, what you tell your friends from out of town to order. You can get it in a soup with <dish>noodles</dish> ($13.95). Or order the barbecue ($22.95), which is still the main draw for those who line up on the stairs to wait for a table.
It doesn’t matter if they believe they’re eating at Wonjo. They’ll leave New Wonjo Restaurant thinking it’s never been better.
