Disco music with raw fish in the East Village may not strike you as a winning formula unless you
remember when Avenue A had what was probably the only sushi bar in the city with a mirror ball and a
D.J. booth. Everybody called it Disco Sushi, and I loved it for reasons that had nothing to do with
the food. I had eaten enough good sushi to know I couldn’t afford it. But cold rice, fake wasabi and
sinewy fish mattered much less when vinyl records and the mirror ball were spinning, the tables were
filling up with musicians waiting for a 1 a.m. gig at Brownies, and we were all on our third round
of sake bombs. I didn’t realize how much I missed Disco Sushi until I found Sushi Dojo, which opened
this summer on First Avenue near East Sixth Street. There were no turntables in sight, but the room
was filled with retro disco. Usually, bone-thumping dance music is the way restaurants say “we hate
you” to their customers. But at Sushi Dojo the tracks by Chromeo, Sare Havlicek and the like were
played at a humane volume and compiled with an evident love for high-sheen, poppy neo-disco. And
while I didn’t spot any sake bombs, plenty of people were getting bombed on sake. Ask the sommelier,
Max Lidukhover, for a recommendation and he’ll give you two samples that would pass for full pours
in other places, and if you’re not wild about either, he’s likely to uncork a third. Along the way
he’ll teach you the basics. “Ginjo sake is very harsh,” he’ll say. “I don’t recommend it unless
you’re looking to get wasted.” This is not necessarily discouraged at Sushi Dojo, where you can see
customers in lip locks, customers waving their arms in full I-love-you-guys mode and customers
buying rounds for the chefs, a Japanese custom that the staff avidly embraces. All this would earn
Sushi Dojo a heartfelt welcome to the neighborhood even if the food didn’t stand out. But it does.
The soul of this party is <dish>sushi</dish> worth getting crazy for, made by three chefs with a strong
traditional bent: Hiromi Suzuki, Makoto Yoshizawa and David Bouhadana. Mr. Bouhadana is  , and the
most exuberant customers seem to gravitate to his end of the counter. One night I asked Ms. Suzuki
for $75 worth of sashimi and sushi, dealer’s choice. <dish>Sashimi</dish> came first: entwined bands of unshy,
oily horse mackerel under a stubble of chives; firm white squares of local striped bass; shiny
sunset-pink Arctic char jolted with lemon; bonito seared by a pass of the blowtorch; a slippery-soft
tongue of raw spotted prawn next to its armored head. The streaks of fresh wasabi I drew with a
chopstick tip underscored what Ms. Suzuki had already done with her knives, her torch and her
seasonings to enhance the texture and taste of each kind of sashimi. Next, she placed one
matchbox-size piece of sushi at a time on a banana leaf: glistening golden-eye snapper; a purplish
strip of needlefish with skin that flashed like steel; <dish>yellowtail belly</dish> that melted like whipped
lard; <dish>wild Alaskan salmon</dish> warmed by Ms. Suzuki’s blowtorch just long enough to melt some of the
oils; and a delicate slip of sea eel, one of the finest I’ve found anywhere. This was more than raw
seafood; it was the work of a thinking chef, and it was a treat. It was also a lot of high-quality
fish for the price. If $75 is beyond your means, an entry-level 10-piece <dish>omakase sushi</dish> meal costs
just $45, although it probably won’t include many seasonal specialties like needlefish or rarities
like live, still-wriggling octopus. Not every piece I had at Sushi Dojo was exceptional; <dish>baby
cuttlefish</dish> refused to surrender its flavor, and I wasn’t sure if a scallop, overpowered by wasabi,
had much to hold on to. The rice can wad together stubbornly rather than falling into separate
grains, too. But its gently vinegared seasoning blooms in the mouth, lifting up the taste of fish.
There is a surprisingly long menu of cooked food, and while it doesn’t quite keep pace with the
sushi, it’s more than respectable. If this kitchen fried it, you want it: s<dish></dish>hrimp in their crackling
shells; a beehive of mizuna and <dish>seafood tempura</dish> with green-tea salt; a horse mackerel’s skeleton,
dispatched to hot oil after you’ve eaten its body as sashimi. Kurumazushi is where I would have gone
in my Disco Sushi days if I’d been able to afford it.
