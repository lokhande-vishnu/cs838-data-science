Flexing its muscles in Cobble Hill is this new sister spot to the already popular Bocca Lupo.
Given its 24 rotating taps of well-curated American beer (standouts of late included bittersweet Founders Red’s Rye and chocolatey North Coast Old Rasputin), it’s been called a gastro-pub. But its clean appearance (blond hickory booths and marble table tops), raw bar and open kitchen make it look  more like a proper restaurant, as does the free-ranging menu.
Indeed, Strong Place seems cut from the Blue Ribbon mold: an ambitious but crowd-pleasing New American bistro with seafood as a draw. But, unlike its potential role model, Strong Place is easily affordable.
A meal here best ranges from light to heavy, refined to bold. Warm up with the chilled <dish>one-pound lobster</dish> served with a terrific <dish>roasted garlic aioli</dish> ($18); or the delicate <dish>fluke crudo</dish> ($9) dressed in lemony agrumato oil  — dotted on one evening with pink peppercorns and American caviar, and on another, perhaps, with sea urchin and diced red pepper.
Forgo the thick, toasted <dish>pain au levain</dish> that comes with the mustardy, caper-rich but nevertheless demure steak tartare ($13), and you’ll enjoy it (and be able to taste it) more. Garnishes add fun and interest, although, like the strips of grilled <dish>Gruyère-and-surimi</dish>  sandwich atop the too-vinegary gazpacho ($7), they can’t always save the dish.
On brawnier plates, meat and beer make buddies. <dish>Sweet littleneck clams</dish> and garlicky nubs of excellent bratwurst swim in a buttery, saline kolsch broth ($11). A porter braise tones the tender <dish>brisket</dish>’s beefy heft ($15). But the best move is the <dish>fried oyster sandwich</dish> ($10): soft-bellied, masa de harina — crusted fatties loll on a pillowy split-top bun with fresh slaw and flowery chervil tartar sauce. It’s crunchy, snappy, soft, salty, creamy, herbaceous and umami all at once.
A few more power lifts like it, and Strong Place will be a bona fide champ.
