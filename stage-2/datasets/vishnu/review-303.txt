IT is almost a cliché of a romantic restaurant: white curtains wafting out into the half-deserted street, light catching on stemless wineglasses, a blur of candles against dark wood. Couples lean forward, suddenly brimming over with things to say to each other. In a short while, it will become so loud you can barely hear yourself speak, but you will not care. This is that little out-of-the-way place you search for from the moment you move to New York, that you stumble upon one hazy night and make yours.
 opened quietly in July, on the western fringe of SoHo. The chef, Felipe Donnelly, and his wife, Tamy Rofe, the charming host, are young, practically newlyweds. Two years ago, they began moonlighting from their day jobs as advertising executives by hosting (
) weekly dinner parties in their TriBeCa apartment for 
. Twitter fame and a cease-and-desist letter from the city health department followed. They rethought their lives. Cómodo — “comfortable” in Spanish — is a result.
Meals proceed more efficiently here (there is no forgetting to put a chicken in the oven, as Mr. Donnelly did once at a dinner party), but there is still an air of cheerful improvisation. Mr. Donnelly, who is of Colombian descent, has lived in Spain, Brazil and Mexico, and his menu rambles.
It is not that easy in this city to find <dish>ajiaco</dish> ($17), a wonder from Bogotá for which soup is too humble a term. It starts with potatoes of three varieties and textures, cooked down into a velvety near-butter and laced with guascas, a grassy herb that leans toward oregano with a wink at catnip. A half-cob of corn is submerged in it. (Yes, eat it.) Further additions are up to you, from saucers of bracing capers; avocado; sour cream; a sharp, translucent habanero salsa; and <dish>shredded chicken</dish>.
Elsewhere, dried cranberries land in succulent lamb patties, tucked inside pão de queijo, Brazilian cheese rolls made with sweet and sour cassava starches so they are dense and sticky on the inside, like gougères collapsed in on themselves ($11). <dish>Charred octopus</dish> is smoky with <dish>mezcal</dish> ($17). In a <dish>swordfish ceviche</dish> ($12), sweet corn and sour lime are counterbalanced by salty celery juice and cancha, an Andean popcorn that swaps fluffiness for crunch.
Entrees are best eaten in conjunction, stealing from your companions’ plates: a bite here of 
 Bolognese transmuted by poblano peppers ($18), one there of staggeringly rich spaghetti-squash 
, surrounded by scallops with halos of chipotle cream ($28). Quickest to disappear will be the <dish>pork</dish>, kneaded with coffee and slow-roasted into a defenseless heap, in the Mexican cochinita pibil style ($24).
Other dishes seem to be works in progress. Seared <dish>duck breast</dish> ($28), dribbled with a sauce based on Mexican Coca-Cola (which is made with sugar, not corn syrup), was perfectly calibrated on one visit and overly sweet on another. <dish>Picanha</dish> ($28), a cut of steak from the rump of the steer, akin to tri-tip, is served without elaboration and requires too much of the jaw. More intriguing is the accompanying farofa, cassava flour toasted into a nutty, crispy dust.
Ingredients are repeated, like motifs. Mushrooms pop up everywhere, unheralded by the menu. Likewise presentations: Mr. Donnelly has a penchant for laying a smear of sauce down the center of the plate, segregating meat to one side, vegetables to the other.
Among the desserts, the simpler the better: a dark <dish>chocolate cake</dish> ($11), brightened by a brigadeiro sauce of condensed milk and passion fruit, and <dish>swollen churros</dish> ($9), still gooey inside, to be dunked in nutmeg-heavy chocolate milk that smells like Christmas.
You would not want Cómodo to be too polished. It feels pleasingly out of step with on-the-make New York, belonging to more languorous clime, where supper doesn’t start until 10 p.m. and evening is one never-finished conversation.
