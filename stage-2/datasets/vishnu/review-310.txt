It would take more than my fingers and toes to count the 
 in recent years, taking their Southern specialties with them to the grave. M & G Diner’s <dish>corn muffins</dish>, gone. Pan Pan’s chicken and <dish>waffles</dish>, gone. Louise’s Family Restaurant’s <dish>fish</dish> and grits, gone.
These places were more than diners, but not quite restaurants; if the term “soul food” still held any meaning in 21st-century New York City, they were its repositories. Newer and sleeker restaurants have sprung up as the neighborhood steams ahead with residential development, and Harlem’s culinary renaissance got a shot in the arm last year when 
, a sleek and creative Asian-African restaurant nearby, made several best-new-restaurants lists.
But while oxtail dumplings and Mexican-Ethiopian <dish>chicken</dish> (served at Marcus Samuelsson’s 
 nearby) are good to have around, it’s a relief any time someone picks up the fraying thread of traditional Southern food in New York and tries to make it right.
Carlos Swepson, a New York chef with roots in Natchez, Miss., who owns 
 with his sister, Joi, has approached the challenge thoughtfully. His best food — like wood-smoked chicken, crisp wild grouper with a cornmeal crust, and exemplary Southern potato salad (with <dish>chopped hard-boiled eggs</dish>) — is pressed right up against tradition, but tweaked for modern taste.
This doesn’t mean he’s putting soy sauce in the sweet potatoes or oven-frying the <dish>chicken</dish>. He’s not importing heirloom grits or country ham. Mr. Swepson simply makes good things taste better, with tricks like stirring Louisiana cane syrup into salted butter for biscuits, <dish>smoking chicken</dish> over mesquite wood chips instead of grilling it with barbecue sauce, and dolloping tangy crème fraîche on blueberry pancakes instead of sweet whipped cream.
He uses a Scotch bonnet hot sauce made locally from fresh chiles; the <dish>chicken</dish> is pan-fried to order; his okra is soaked in buttermilk, encased whole in a light crust of cornmeal and flour, and served with a lemon- and pepper-spiked ketchup. (At $9 a plateful, it is also a bargain.) At brunch, perhaps the best meal here, the light and shaggy biscuits collapse into a delicious heap under a weighty layer of scrambled eggs and melted Cheddar.
In the grand tradition of the Southern meat-and-three, Mr. Swepson’s sides — like collard greens, red beans and rice, and black-eyed peas — are just as carefully seasoned as the mains. Not surprisingly, he goes awry with the menu items that lean trendy, not traditional: a kale Caesar salad of tough leaves glued together with a sticky, salty dressing; short-rib <dish>tacos</dish>, a random-seeming handful of chewy ingredients folded into raw-tasting tortillas; shrimp and grits gussied up with grilled, undercooked <dish>jumbo shrimp</dish>. And some things are just beyond: A pair of <dish>fried chicken</dish> sliders on buttermilk biscuits doesn’t also want Cheddar and ranch dressing. Macaroni with seven (count ’em) cheeses could do without a sheet of bacon on top.
Wedged into the ground-floor corner of a still-to-be-renovated brownstone, with an appealing combination of old (tin ceiling, brick walls, polite servers) and new (snappy logo, chic uniforms, responsibly sourced meats), BLVD Bistro is smart but casual, probably why it’s been an instant hit. It can be insanely hot and screamingly loud when too many people are stuffed into the space, but cozy and humming at just the right level at other times. The restaurant is restricted to serving wine and beer, so the crowd skews toward the quiet and food-loving.
BLVD Bistro will not astound anyone, but it will satisfy everyone, and sometimes that’s more than enough.
