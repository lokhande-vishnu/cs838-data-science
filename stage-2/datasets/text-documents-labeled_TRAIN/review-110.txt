Zing’s Awesome Rice
Chinese
122 Ludlow Street,

Among the sins of <dish>fried rice</dish>: too much oil, vegetables that taste only of the freezer they were
stored in, grains gone to mush or ossified into tiny, brittle fangs. And yet the dish, even when
made without artistry, diligence or the remotest interest in freshness, almost always satisfies. At
, a discreet little takeout shop (with a table and a few stools) that opened in November on the
Lower East Side, rice is less specialty than obsession. The triumphal name is justified on the back
of the short menu with bullet points explaining what makes the fried rice here stand apart. Above
all, it isn’t fried. The chef and owner, Haijing Bai, known as Zing, calls it seared rice. She grew
up in Beijing and holds a law degree from Cornell, along with an M.B.A. from Hawaii Pacific
University. (Nostalgia recently inspired a “Hawaiian surfer special” featuring Spam.) Until last
June, she practiced as a lawyer, before giving in to friends who kept asking at her dinner parties
when she was going to open a restaurant. Here she begins by steeping raw grains of rice in olive oil
and seasonings whose precise calibration she hesitates to reveal. The menu likens this technique to
the way “steakhouses marinate their steaks,” although a better comparison may be to the priming of
rice with oil and salt to make congee. In “ ,” Eileen Yin-Fei Lo wrote sternly: “Do not be tempted
to use olive oil for Chinese cooking. Its aroma and consistency are incompatible with Chinese
foods.” At Zing’s, however, it works, lending plumpness to the grains and amplifying their natural
earthiness. Recipes for fried rice typically advise using leftovers instead of newly made rice,
which tends to clot. Ms. Bai’s solution: Once steamed, the rice is spread on a baking sheet and
popped briefly into the oven. Only then is it deemed strong enough to stand up to the heavy pan that
Ms. Bai uses in lieu of a thin-skinned wok, pressing the rice hard against the flat bottom to sear
it. (The word “sear” had me hoping for the crackling, near-burnt crust of Korean bibimbap or Spanish
paella, but Ms. Bai prefers her rice uncharred.) More olive oil goes into the pan, a parsimonious
amount, so the finished rice arrives shining and wafting heat. A “secret” sauce is also added, of
which no detail could be elicited beyond its being Cantonese in origin. Sometimes it leaves the rice
loose but still moist, with a vague hint of brine. Sometimes it vanishes so thoroughly that remedial
dashes of soy and chile (available on the counter) are required. Yellow-and-white rags of roughly
<dish>scrambled eggs</dish> are cooked separately and then tossed in. Likewise the six choices of protein on
offer, the best of which are the most aggressive in flavor: <dish>sweet-salty lap cheung</dish> (Chinese
sausage), thick tabs of <dish>bacon and baby shrimp sluiced with vinegar</dish>. Less time commingling in the pan
means that each addition remains distinct. The result is lighter and cleaner in flavor, but it’s
kind of like a rock band recording each instrument in isolation to a click track. Some improvisatory
wildness is lost. Nevertheless, the rice at Zing’s can surprise if you upgrade from white sushi rice
to brown or, better yet, purple, whose bruised-looking grains are chewy within and almost crunchy
without. Also known as forbidden rice, it was once believed to prolong life and was reserved for
emperors, and has enough savoriness to make up for the occasional reticence of the secret sauce.
Elsewhere on the menu are a few appetizers of Ms. Bai’s invention, including skewers of martini
olives and <dish>hard-boiled quail eggs</dish> (an hors d’oeuvre from her dinner parties) and an odd, sour tomato
soup heavy with coconut milk and chopped ginger. More classic is a near mash of tofu and preserved
duck eggs, gray-green and slippery. Note that the seared rice here is twice as expensive as the
fried rice you will find a few blocks away in Chinatown. You can make an argument for freshness,
zeal and cost of ingredients, and still wish that Ms. Bai would trim prices just a little. A plea,
too, to bring back the Spam special, with its flicker of Hawaii. On a bitter winter’s night, it may
approach the vicinity of awesome.
