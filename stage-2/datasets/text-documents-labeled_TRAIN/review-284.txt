Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu’s Kitchen

In the hedonist’s view of American immigration patterns, bad times for chefs in China are good times for <dish>dumpling</dish> chasers and noodle hunters in New York. When experienced cooks couldn’t make a living there for political or economic reasons, they came here. Conversely, over the last decade or so, the hypertrophic Chinese economy has left the kitchens of our Chinatowns somewhat flattened, with fewer high peaks of talent standing out in the landscape.
But a cash-flush China may be working to the advantage of New Yorkers for once. An energetic entrepreneur named Zhu Rong, who owns restaurants in four cities around China, recently expanded her territory to Greenwich Village with a place she has named (take a breath) 
 (exhale). Ms. Zhu brought along a pair of chefs whose skillful manipulation of bubbling oil, steam and smoking-hot woks is evident in almost everything they cook. They also know a thing or two about dough and hot peppers.
The traditions invoked by the menu come mainly from Beijing, Shanghai and Ms. Zhu’s hometown, Chongqing. The interpretations are contemporary. The portions are generally bigger than a street snack but smaller than one of those platters that descends with a thunk on the Lazy Susans of Chinatown. The food is sometimes arranged with an attention to negative space that can make you wish you saw less plate and more food. Balancing any spareness, though, are the spicy intensity of some dishes and the stripped-down purity of others.
The chefs are virtuosic fryers, able to express many nuances in the simple language of crust. The coating on the <dish>fish fritters</dish> is almost as soft as cake crumbs, a pale gold tinted green by seaweed powder. It’s a subtle partner for the delicate <dish>fish</dish> inside.
<dish>Crispy shrimp</dish> sauté has a more rugged crunch, almost in <dish>fried chicken territory</dish>, with dark, thrilling slips of dried chiles clinging to it. Between the two extremes are the wonderful cubes of <dish>creamy tofu</dish> inside a crisp and ultrathin shell; they’re like <dish>mozzarella sticks</dish> refined to the nth degree.
Everything on the menu’s many pages gets a color photo, and it all looks good. Mostly, it is. Lunch or dinner might start with chilled appetizers like the fresh and tender clams in a stack of quietly seasoned Chinese chives; or the juicy smoked sole, marinated in sweet soy sauce. Both were exceptional. So was the chilled salad of poached grape tomatoes. Fizzy on the inside and infused with plum syrup, they were a quick respite from the weather on a muggy summer day.
Cold sliced <dish>beef</dish> shank, a Sichuan notion, pulled its punches on the night I tried it. But other cold appetizers from that region, like the translucent logs of mung bean jelly stacked up under a chile and fermented black bean sauce, landed all the expected body blows and uppercuts. There are excellent wood ear mushrooms, floppy and crisp at the same time in their dressing of vinegar and a dose of chile oil that will sneak up on the unwary.
The more familiar dishes are some of the least interesting. Sweet and sour <dish>pork</dish> with pineapple was less sugary than usual, but I still left it alone. Seafood pancakes are tough and oily triangles that lack the tender layering that makes scallion pancakes so appealing. Something called rainbow salad is a plate of quinoa and carrots that you’d be happy enough to find at the company cafeteria.
All danger of dullness is obliterated, though, when Madam Zhu’s <dish>Spicy Fish Stew</dish> shows up. It’s a Sichuanese inspiration, with a <dish>flaky fish</dish> in a lightly sour green broth so packed with fresh chiles that it brought all conversation, not to mention rational thought, to a standstill.
The <dish>noodles</dish> and dumplings are toward the back of the menu, and tend to arrive near the meal’s end. The <dish>bacon sticky rice shumai</dish>, sheer wrappers that barely contain their stuffing, have instantly entered New York’s gallery of great dim sum. Everybody at my table marveled, too, at the half-moons called clay pot dumplings: These tender wrappers of <dish>cooked egg</dish> folded over pork and water chestnuts are something like omelets crossed with pierogies that moved into a bowl of soup.
The only part of the menu I found unreliable was, oddly enough, the noodles. On a night when the restaurant was at full capacity, the Taiwanese pork noodles were monotonously sweet, and the dan dan noodles were an unfocused blur. But they and other dishes — there’s a fascinating and novel bowl of fresh tomato soup with ragged hand-pulled flat noodles and gingery pork meatballs — were excellent on slower days. I wondered if the kitchen had simply been moving too quickly.
To gloss one of the eight words in the restaurant’s name: The tea is very good. There is delicate silver needle and white peony, pungently herbal green tea grown at high elevations, and a fine aged oolong, among others. The servers never seem to suggest tea, but once you order it they do remember to refresh your pot with hot water until the leaves have given all they’ve got.
Ms. Zhu is a refugee from the art gallery business and she brings an airy, creative aesthetic to her restaurants. With framed prints of 
’s window-peeping photography on the walls and a long, rough-grained communal table in the center of the room, Hao Noodle and Tea looks like an especially nice Brooklyn espresso bar where the rapture has arrived and taken only the laptops. There is enough space between the white tables and chairs to drive a riding lawn mower.
Even the people at my table who are normally unmoved by Chinese sweets were impressed by the desserts. Slippery, cool taro soup was soothingly bland, which is no put-down. The rosewater jelly was the real surprise, broken into shards as sparklingly clear as cold vodka.
