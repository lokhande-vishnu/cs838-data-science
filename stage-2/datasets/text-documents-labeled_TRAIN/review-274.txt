Abistro
African
250 DeKalb Avenue,

IN FORT GREENE, Brooklyn,  the four corners of Africa can be reached within a few blocks. With the stalwart Madiba representing the south for years, three other restaurants have staked claims  to west, east, and north.
Some restaurants make you feel as if  you’re the reason for their existence. From  the moment you enter, everything seems to revolve around you.
Abistro is different. Step inside and it’s as if you’ve stumbled into the middle of a lively conversation that’s been going on for days, even years. You’re welcomed warmly, but don’t expect to impose your own rhythm on the proceedings.
The cuisine, a fusion of West African flavors and French technique, is the vision of Abdoul Gueye, a Senegalese who opened Abistro with his wife, Cassandra, in 2005. Although Mr. Gueye no longer works the stoves, he oversees nightly service and, his staff members say, adds secret spices to dishes when their backs are turned.
Unpretentious pleasures include <dish>akara</dish> ($12), <dish>featherweight cod</dish> and <dish>black-eyed pea fritters</dish>, and coconut plantains ($8), sweet and gooey. Order the first-rate hamburger and the waitress will declare, “You want the Senegalese salsa.” She’s right: the stuff should be sold by the jar.
A few touches are eye-opening. The <dish>jasmine-rice cake</dish> that comes with <dish>Senegalese fried chicken</dish> ($15 a half portion or $21 a full portion) is infused with pineapple, but tastes not so much of the fruit as of its scent, if that’s possible.
A communal atmosphere prevails: the dishwasher might double as garde manger, the manager might be on pastry duty and tables might be pushed together for parties that show up despite the restaurant’s location at the end of a sleepy brownstone block.
Bati, which opened in January, has a slightly improvised air. Behind red lattice windows, a demure chandelier hangs incongruously amid a field of downlights. Two abbreviated banquettes bracket the shallow room; a lone mesob, an Ethiopian woven-basket table, sits in a corner.
But once the food arrives, you feel as if  you’re on solid ground. The anchor of an Ethiopian meal is injera, a flatbread traditionally made from teff, a grain indigenous to East Africa. Some restaurants  use other flours, but Bati’s injera is the real thing, dusky in color and springy to the touch.
Injera is a base and an ingredient. It’s added to fresh 
 and surprisingly hot green chilies in the ye timatim fitfit ($5), a salad akin to Italian panzanella.
Whole <dish>hard-boiled eggs</dish> pop up like Cracker Jack prizes in the doro wett ($15), a <dish>chicken stew</dish>. The meat combination ($15) has a lineup of two <dish>beef-sirloin wetts</dish>, differentiated by gradations of cardamom, and lamb simmered with caramelized onions.
The vegetarian dishes ($11.95 each; combination of four, $14) are more muted, from shiro, a dense slurry of ground chick peas, to gomen, a gently garlicky sauté of collard greens.
Food is replenished upon request, with seconds spooned directly onto your platter. No utensils are provided; instead, batons of rolled-up injera, for sopping up the stews, are brandished by a vigilant Russian waitress, like towels at a public bath.
At first, the hookahs coiled in Kif’s windows suggest a pandering exotica. But the casbah-chic interior turns out to be  genuinely  romantic, with antique-red velvet banquettes and beaded-edge burlap curtains.
Moroccan lanterns, embedded with colored glass, lend everything a jeweled hue. Silver-framed mirrors and black-and-white National Geographic-esque photographs are crammed artfully on the walls. In the summer, there’s a tented roof out back.
The menu includes hipster favorites like corn on the <dish>cob</dish> ($3) and <dish>lamb sliders</dish> ($6); one entree even features a “Tex-Mex” pilaf. But the Moroccan dishes distinguish the kitchen.
The <dish>falafel</dish> ($6) is moist and bursting with mint, the <dish>roasted eggplant purée</dish> ($5) chunky and lush. In the <dish>chicken tagine</dish> ($16), presented in its namesake clay pot, the slow-braised meat is mixed with fleshy green olives and heady with preserved lemon.
The sauce for the <dish>couscous royal</dish> ($21), a triple threat of <dish>lamb</dish>, <dish>chicken</dish> and succulent merguez, is served in a separate bowl, with sides of harissa and raisins to make it hotter or sweeter. The waiter will note that in Morocco they like their couscous “wet” and pour the whole bowl in; you would do well to follow their lead.
