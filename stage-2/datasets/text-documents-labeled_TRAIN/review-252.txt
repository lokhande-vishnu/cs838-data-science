Dos Toros Taqueria

IF the Dos Toros Taqueria just off Union Square brings to mind the sort of fresh, quick and cheap eating found at Mexican joints in the San Francisco Bay Area, that’s by design.
It was opened by Leo and Oliver Kremer, brothers from  Berkeley, Calif., who worshiped Gordo Taqueria, a Bay Area favorite founded in 1977. Dos Toros is something of an homage.
There are the heavy wood and leather stools, recognizable to anybody who has devoured a burrito at Gordo.
And there is the simple and succulent food, stripped-down cooking served in spartan conditions. Like  Gordo, Dos Toros has a short menu, high standards and such satisfying fare you don’t mind the hospital lighting.
First, the menu, which is  essentially just three items long:  a <dish>taco</dish> ($3.67), <dish>burrito</dish> ($7.35) or <dish>quesadilla</dish> ($5.97). (A fourth option, the plato, $7.35, is just a burrito without the tortilla.) After you settle on a preparation, you have a choice of meat (carnitas, carne asada or pollo asado)  or vegetarian black or <dish>pinto beans</dish>.
The <dish>tacos</dish> are made with <dish>tortillas</dish> from <dish>Tortillería Nixtamal</dish>, the shop in Corona, Queens,  that  grinds corn for its own masa. The <dish>burrito</dish> is no bean bomb: the flavorful filling is bright and balanced, a luscious layering of meat, salsas, beans and <dish>rice</dish>. When asked if you want a scoop of guacamole (92 cents), the correct answer is “yes.”
The quesadilla is the biggest surprise. At most taquerias, it’s the underperformer, a second-string dish. The version at Dos Toros is a marquee player.
A flour tortilla  crisped on the griddle with a thin slice of Jack cheese (it melts better), the quesadilla is piled with meat and topped with pico de gallo and hot sauce. Folded into thirds, it keeps its crunch until the last bite, less gooey disk than blistered dosa.
The carnitas are juicy and rich, the pork seared, slow-cooked then seared again. The carne asada is marinated flap steak (a flavorful cut similar  to  skirt)  grilled to a perfectly pink medium-rare. If questionable meat at some taquerias hides behind an overly charred crust, the beef at Dos Toros is more straightforward: it tastes like steak.
Even the <dish>chicken</dish> in the pollo asado shines here. Dark meat is brined, rubbed with spices the brothers won’t divulge, then grilled and chopped. The pieces stay moist, should you lose yourself in conversation mid-taco.
Condiments are just as considered. The hot sauces are freshly made, not bottled. You have a choice between mild green serrano and jalapeño or spicy red habanero. Both are tangy and sharp, as much about flavor as firepower.
The portions and prices are calibrated correctly. These aren’t dainty designer <dish>tacos</dish> or bulging bargain-basement <dish>burritos</dish>. Instead, the food is sensible, filling without being excessive. Order the quesadilla with a side of chips and <dish>guacamole</dish> ($3.22) and a <dish>Tecate</dish> ($2.30) and you’re sated for less than $12.
It’s college-town food, served in plastic baskets lined with wax paper. Unlike at some of the more flamboyant  Mexican restaurants around New York, there are no elaborate attempts at Mexican authenticity. There’s no need for tongue <dish>tacos</dish>, huitlacoche or wrestling posters. Instead, the room has a brawny simplicity, with reclaimed wood and raw concrete.
The front of the taqueria opens onto the street when weather permits. It’s an optimistic touch from a sunnier climate.
There are other  West Coast details: the biodegradable corn-based utensils, the aggressive composting policy, the disarmingly nice staff.
In fact, the attitude at Dos Toros may be the most Californian thing about it, that laid-back confidence. The Kremers sweat the small things in the kitchen. Then they let the food speak for itself.
