Nitehawk Cinema

With the exception of what’s on the screen, Nitehawk Cinema has almost nothing in common with other movie theaters.
Example A: the <dish>popcorn</dish>. The kernels are white, not sickly faux gold. They are topped with a delicious mix of lime juice, mild cotija 
 and cilantro leaves. The $5 serving, in a stainless-steel bowl instead of a paper bucket, could easily satisfy three, and no one will need an overpriced soda to slake a salt-induced thirst.
The food is the draw here. The menu, designed by Saul Bolton, the owner of Saul in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, includes a selection of made-over classic snacks, as well as full-on entrees and desserts. There are also specials inspired by the films. The <dish>Spread Eagle plate</dish> ($13) of juicy <dish>fried chicken</dish>, <dish>mashed potatoes</dish> and <dish>cake</dish> was offered at a screening of “Tabloid.” For “Bellflower,” there were soy-glazed and chocolate-covered <dish>crickets</dish> ($5).
The three theaters are designed with comfy chairs and triangular tables. There is no obligation to eat. But if you want to, arrive early. (You can also order during the show.) State law forbids alcoholic drinks in the theater. They are, however, available at the lobby cafe before and after the show.
Popcorn is a must. So are the <dish>cheese empanadas</dish> ($6), two <dish>greaseless turnovers</dish> stuffed with mozzarella and cotija and served with salsa verde. If you are feeling nostalgic, the <dish>puppy dogs</dish> ($6), a k a mini corn dogs, are sweet and salty. The side of smoky house-made ketchup elevates them for a grown-up palate.
If a full dinner and a movie is what you are after, the <dish>burger</dish> ($13) won’t disappoint. It’s nicely charred and served on a soft bun with plenty of fries or . The mix of crisp romaine, red onion and was fine with the <dish>grilled chicken sandwich</dish> ($13), though it would have benefited from a fresher pretzel roll.
<dish>Chewy brownies</dish> tucked into a twist of chocolate-vanilla soft and topped with whipped cream ($8) are worth the trip.
But almost every option offers a good reason to see that movie now, rather than wait for the DVD.
