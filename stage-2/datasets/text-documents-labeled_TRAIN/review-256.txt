If you ask, the patient people at Khao Kang will identify the dozen unlabeled dishes on the steam table for you, but this will not necessarily help. Their one-word descriptions (“<dish>shrimp</dish>,” “<dish>chicken</dish>” and, repeatedly, “<dish>pork</dish>”) tell nothing of the layers of flavor, surprises and comforts to be found here, in one of the sincerest Thai restaurants in New York City.
Perhaps “restaurant” is an exaggeration. There is no menu, no wait service. Food is made in advance, throughout the day, and presented cafeteria style. Do not look askance. The steam-table joint is based on an honorable and beloved class of establishment in Thailand known as raan khao kaeng, or rice-curry shop, sometimes just a sidewalk stall with giant pots and a few plastic chairs that patrons circle and stalk.
Khao Kang, which opened in February in Elmhurst, Queens, has a prettier setup, with shaggy grass and daffodils spilling out of flower boxes out front, tall black-framed French windows and its name in burnished font across dark weathered wood. Inside, tables and chairs repeat the weathered motif, with stray mottles and yellow-green stripes.
The steam table is shielded by glass; to order, you point. Each plate comes with a formidable amount of <dish>rice</dish>, surrounded by slightly more restrained servings of the entrees of your choice: $7 for two, $7.50 for three. (You can buy a larger portion of a single entree for $8, with a $1 side of rice, but how to choose just one?)
The trick, if you are neither Thai nor a scholar of the cuisine, is figuring out how to mix and match dishes. The people who work here are too polite to meddle, so, short of having 
 on speed dial, you’re left with snooping on the neighbors.
On a recent evening, it seemed that everyone had chosen squiggles of <dish>fried garlic pork</dish> with a crackly veneer and a tease of sugar. Other favored dishes included pumpkin, tender without losing crunch, amid broken strands of <dish>egg</dish>; <dish>pork belly</dish> stewed with patches of tofu and whole <dish>hard-boiled eggs</dish> stained through to the yolk with soy, all suffused with cinnamon and star anise, sweet and mild; a tangle of pork and watercress with a hidden smolder; and green curry with <dish>eggplants</dish> the size of gumballs. All proved terrific.
Occasionally during the pointing-and-ordering process, a dish is not identified, simply warned against. “Very hot,” the man behind the counter says anxiously. He means it. Choose certain curries, and they will be carefully spooned into separate bowls, as if to contain their nuclear threat. Some are hot from the first drop; others lull you with initial innocuousness, then combust. One culprit was jungle curry, which burned steadily in my mouth for a good five minutes, annihilating all sense of taste. Another was an intensely sour curry, littered with broad, flat stink beans for a counterpunch of funk.
The chef and owner, Sopon Kosalanan, grew up in Chanthaburi Province, in eastern Thailand, and came to New York 10 years ago. He learned to cook from his grandmother and his mother, Thong Tad Charernnan, who helps in the kitchen, along with his aunt. His brother and sister-in-law work the steam table, his niece the cash register and dessert case.
On a chalkboard, someone has written, “The best Thai dessert ever in NYC.” A case could be made for most of them: wedges of pumpkin, hollowed out and piped with <dish>coconut custard</dish>; <dish>rice-flour cakes</dish> green with pandan juice under snowy coconut cream; sticky black <dish>rice</dish> pudding splashed with coconut milk, delightfully more salty than sweet.
“Rubies,” water chestnuts colored red and rolled in tapioca flour, come afloat in coconut milk and pandan syrup. The milk is suffused with the scent of an incense candle, which is less mysterious than the fact that it is heated right before being topped with shaved ice. Eat it quickly.
Then for the subway ride home, petits fours, of a sort: luk chup, marzipan’s doppelgänger, made from mung-bean paste and molded to look like shiny little fruits, and pastel-hued rice-flour muffins, steamed and barely there, tinged with jasmine water and tasting like mouthfuls of perfumed air.
