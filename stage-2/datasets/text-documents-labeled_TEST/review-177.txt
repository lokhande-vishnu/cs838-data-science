Mile End
Deli
97A Hoyt Street,
718-852-7510
EARLY evening at Mile End, and the air is heady with the scent of meat. A few breaths, and the head
swims. It is unsubtle, reckless, potentially ruinous. A vegetarian, accidentally stumbling by, might
wake up the next morning and not remember a thing. Mile End opened a year ago in Boerum Hill,
Brooklyn, and has been standing room only ever since. It is, technically, a deli, although that is
sort of like saying that Quentin Tarantino makes B movies. Rather, it is a loving tribute to the
deli tradition, whose guilty, cholesterol-laden pleasures are  uplifted here with first-class
ingredients. Everything is cured, smoked or pickled in house. (Perhaps this should be Brooklyn’s new
slogan,  Mr. Markowitz.) The restaurant takes its name from Montreal’s historically working-class
Jewish quarter, now a hipster neighborhood à la Williamsburg. Hockey photos hang in the bathroom.
(Noah Bernamoff, who runs Mile End with his wife, Rae Cohen, played hockey at McGill.) By day Mile
End purveys compact, <dish>chewy bagels</dish> trucked down from St-Viateur bakery in Montreal ($2.50 each) and
<dish>sandwiches crammed with smoked meat</dish>, the Québécois version of <dish>pastrami</dish> ($9 for 7  ounces, $17 for 14
ounces). But lately things have been interesting after dark. In October, Mr. Bernamoff and Ms. Cohen
hired Aaron Israel, previously a sous chef at Torrisi Italian Specialties, to expand the dinner
menu. Mr. Israel seems intent on doing for humble home-style Ashkenazi food what the gentlemen at
Torrisi are doing for Italian-American: update and elevate. To that end, there is <dish>cholent</dish> ($18), a
stew traditionally prepared on a Friday and slow-cooked overnight, to get around the proscription
against lighting a fire and cooking on the Sabbath. It is meant to be eaten at noon, but on an icy
night no one will complain. The buried treasures are a <dish>plump sweetbread kishke</dish>, or sausage, and a
veal short rib that collapses at the touch. <dish>Poulet juif</dish> ($16) surprises with an infusion of smoke.
<dish>Trout</dish> ($16) is dressed simply, with pickled beets and shallots, atop a skim of horseradish cream.
These are comforting dishes, well made. Best is the whole <dish>mishpucha</dish> ($12 a person), a soup whose
name means family in Yiddish. Served in a Chinese hot pot (perhaps in a nod to the other Jewish
comfort food?), it brims with fluffy matzo balls; delicate chicken-liver kreplach, or <dish>dumplings</dish>;
mandlen,<dish> oyster-cracker-ish croutons</dish>; strands of  <dish>lo mein</dish>; kale; carrots; and a hunk of pounded and
poached chicken breast. But what’s with the salt? The most egregious offenders are the kasha
varnishkes, a muddle of buckwheat, bowtie pasta and chicken gizzards ($8 small, $14 large), and the
poutine, <dish>French fries</dish> topped with cheese curds and an oppressive gravy ($8 classic, $11 with smoked
meat). I am ordinarily defenseless before French fries, but even I could resist these. A quartino of
the house <dish>Côte-du-Rhône</dish> ($10) will rectify matters. Or — beyond the purview of this column, alas — a
bottle of Mourvèdre from the Berkeley, Calif.-based winery <dish>Donkey and  Goat</dish> ($45). The space, a
former garage, is minimally but fastidiously designed: concrete floors, white bentwood coat hangers,
black scissor-arm pharmacy lamps extended from the wall just so. Five vintage Woolworth’s stools
line the counter. Kitchen towels serve as napkins. In lieu of booths, there are three communal
tables, each roomy enough for four strangers or six very close friends, and one tiny two-top
squeezed against the window. No reservations are taken, and waits can be exasperating, although you
may enjoy the birdsong being piped outside as part of the Birds of Brooklyn art project.
