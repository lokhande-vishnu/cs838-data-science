IN the valley of the shadow of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, where bearded Hasidim cross paths with mustachioed steam punks, stands the restaurant Traif.
The name, in  Yiddish, refers to food forbidden under Jewish dietary law. To underscore the point, the front door has the logo of a cute little piggy stamped with a heart.
Some would call this wit, others blasphemy. No matter. The name generated plenty of buzz before the place opened in April, which presumably was the intent of the owners, Jason Marcus, the chef, and his girlfriend, Heather Heuser. (He’s Jewish, she’s not.)
But here is Traif’s little secret: it is, simply, a very nice restaurant. There’s nothing outré about the food, which is for the most part delicious and well made. The cooking is thoughtful, the flavors subtle and complex, the prices reasonable.
Yes, there is <dish>pork belly</dish> ($8); <dish>calamari</dish> ($8); a <dish>flat-iron</dish> steak with  <dish>blue-cheese butter</dish> ($18). But no kid goat seethed in its mother’s milk. No frog legs or rabbit. Not even filet mignon.
A sizable portion of the mostly-small-plates menu isn’t traif at all. One of the loveliest dishes is a 
 of virtuous baby spinach, tumbled with oranges and grapes, earthy roasted carrots, and feta and sunflower seeds for a touch of musk ($6).
And Mr. Marcus, although he wants to be a bad boy, is a very nice restaurateur.
He has a degree in philosophy and a respectable culinary résumé, with stints at Le Bernardin and Eleven Madison Park. At Traif, he works alongside his staff — one cook on a slow night, two when it’s busy — in an extremely abbreviated open kitchen behind the bar. He’s bespectacled, polite to nosy customers.
He’s been diverted by the charms of the East. The best dishes have an Asian inflection. <dish>Hamachi</dish> ($9),  draped over crescents of nectarine so that the juices commingle, gets a minimalist squeeze of lime and a crush of holy basil, heightening the  vivid flavors.
Duck confit ($8) comes shredded, to be bundled in lettuce leaves and dredged through a banana-tamarind nam prik, a hot-sour-sweet chili paste that suits the sweetness of the duck.
A stock appetizer of tuna tartare gets new life with a drizzle of kecap manis, a syrupy Indonesian concoction fueled by soy and palm sugar.
But you want to hear about the taboo stuff. Rock shrimp are strewn over puffy corn cakes, their brine buffered by a <dish>mango-tomatillo salsa</dish> ($8);   chubby scallops arrive saturated in a fragrant sage-pistachio brown butter ($16);  cockles get intimate with pancetta  in a delicate 
 with a chili sucker punch ($12).
Then there was the seared foie gras, slumming it with fingerling potatoes, crisp shards of ham, and a fried egg, all dribbled with maple syrup and hot sauce ($15).   Now this is chutzpah. Eric Ripert might weep to see foie gras treated thus. It’s  what you eat after a night of slugging Cristal. It’s the Beastie Boys shrieking “Sabotage!”
Bacon pops up at dessert, atop <dish>ponderous doughnuts</dish> ($6),  and on cocktails. Nothing quite prepares you for the sight of the tequila-based Rude Little Pig  ($10), its rim sequined with crimson flecks of meat. In both cases salt would have done fine.
At times the menu seems disjointed. The delicate Asian-tinged dishes have nothing in common with the more prosaic bar food: the inevitable meatballs ($7)   and sliders ($8).  Mr. Marcus executes all this with skill, but it doesn’t say much about him as a chef.
The interior design is a little unfocused, too. There are orange stools at the long bar and one turquoise wall with a small flat-screen TV with “Iron Chef” on permanent, silent loop. When asked if you’d like to sit outside, say yes.
On a stone patio, small  tables nestle under a bower  at the edge of a garden — lush, riotously green, with flowers, bushes, trees. You sit and stare, not daring to enter this promised land.
