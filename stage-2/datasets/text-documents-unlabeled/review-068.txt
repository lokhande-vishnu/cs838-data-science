A-Wah



As you step inside this shoebox of a restaurant just south of Chatham Square, you will spot a half-dozen or so sealed pots on the cooktop behind the counter.
In the bright, homey dining room, where tables are topped with checked cloths, diners will likely be digging in to these pots, the restaurant’s specialty.
But these bo zai fan — loosely, “clay pot rice” in Cantonese — are easy to miss on the 300-item menu. Look for “world famous rice in casserole.”
At A-Wah, which the chef and owner Wang Jian Wah opened in March, this Hong Kong comfort food is served in 17 varieties. Each features toppings — salted chicken leg, beef and egg, eel, “three kind of mushrooms” — whose flavors imbue the rice during cooking. It is hard to pass over the house special of Chinese sausage, minced pork and fatty bacon ($8.50), except perhaps in favor of Chinese sausage and preserved duck ($6.25).
When your bo zai fan arrives, top it immediately with thick, sweet house-made soy sauce, then mix, freeing some crusty rice from the side of the clay pot. By this time the fragrance will be intoxicating.
One clay pot, especially when bolstered by extra sausage ($2) or a duck leg ($2.50), can feed one hungry diner.
Share, and you can also sample minnow-size “silver fish with pepper salt” ($6.95), lightly battered and fried whole; vinegary and ever-so-slightly crunchy 
 salad ($7.95); sautéed pea shoots (market price), or maybe a small plate of that crispy pig ($6) hanging in the window.
Milk and egg-white ginger flan ($2) is a refreshing chilled dessert. Or chew on warm, oozy black-sesame-filled rice balls ($2) rolled in crushed peanuts.
