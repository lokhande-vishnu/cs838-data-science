IF 
’s culinary muse is Berkshire pork, Christina Tosi’s must be breakfast cereal.
Corn flakes, Lucky Charms, Fruity Pebbles, Cap’n Crunch — all have made appearances at Momofuku Milk Bar, the recently opened laboratory for Ms. Tosi’s desserts and the latest addition to Mr. Chang’s East Village empire.
They’re the flavors of a much-ballyhooed series of soft-serve ice creams ($4, cup or cone) inspired by dregs at the bottom of a cereal bowl. The result is evocative rather than literal, as if the 
 were perfumed.
Their spirit — magically delicious! — extends to the entire menu, which is a time capsule of arrested adolescence, an homage to American processed food. This isn’t what your mom used to make; it’s what you used to beg her to buy.
How much of it appeals to you now depends on whether you salute the notion that when you’re grown up, no one can stop you from eating a bowl of cereal for dinner.
Or candy-bar pie for breakfast, as Ms. Tosi, Milk Bar’s pastry chef, professes to do. With layers  of caramel, peanut-butter nougat seeded with peanut brittle and 
 glaze, the pie ($5 a slice) speaks to a primal sugar instinct. It’s tasty, if not subtle.
As with all things Momofuku-related, Milk Bar has been greeted with an apostolic fervor.
But the no-frills space, connected to Momofuku Ssam Bar by a short hallway, discourages lingering groupies. Orders are placed and picked up in to-go boxes at the counter. You may consume your goods on the spot, if you don’t mind eating standing up at one of the high communal tables.
The menu is in constant flux, a testament to Ms. Tosi’s hyperactive imagination. (In the ice creams, for example, cereal milk has given way to variants of doughnut.)
But stalwarts are the 
, colossal, craggy masterpieces of texture ($1.75 each) baked at high heat so they’re lightly crisp on the outside and nearly raw at the center.
The best are committed to a single flavor. The blueberry-cream cookie is the neutron-star version of a blueberry muffin. The corn is to corn bread what condensed milk is to milk.
But the compost cookie, which includes potato chips, pretzels, 
 grounds, oats, graham-cracker crumbs and chocolate and butterscotch chips, tastes like nothing in particular, as if the ingredients canceled out one another.
The crack pie ($5 a slice) is essentially a pecan pie minus the pecans, which would’ve helped cut the sweetness. After one bite, my pulse was galloping.
I overheard a customer complaining to the counterwoman about the small size of his slice. He should have thanked her for saving his life.
The mantra of excess reaches fruition in the behemoth layer cakes ($5 a slice). In one, an unfortunate juxtaposition of chocolate chips and passion-fruit curd conjures a midnight run to the deli for a quart of Tropicana and cookie-dough ice cream, to be devoured on the couch while watching TV. This is cuisine for Harold and Kumar.
Savory items are theoretically available, but scarce. In my several visits, I never encountered the English muffin with bacon and egg (a hat-tip to the Egg McMuffin) or the kim-chi-and-blue-cheese croissant.
David Chang’s revered pork-belly buns are offered ($9 for two), although they’re not quite as transcendent as they are next door, even though they are prepped in the same kitchen. The hoisin sauce seems to be laid on with a heavier hand.
Focaccia studded with Chinese sausage  ($6) is an oily, fiery success. But chorizo challah ($7 a loaf), a gleefully sacrilegious idea, is dry and oversweet.
A hefty knish called a volcano ($9) disgorges a gloppy mass of potato gratin, molten Gruyère, Mornay sauce, onions and bacon. Despite the high-end ingredients, its beige creaminess brought back queasy memories of my high school cafeteria.
And therein lies the conundrum of Milk Bar. Some of Ms. Tosi’s experiments are playful and deeply satisfying. But others are over the top, as if conceived in a fit of the munchies. They seem like a good idea at the time, but leave you woozy and depleted. Maybe Mom was right when she warned you not to spoil your appetite.
