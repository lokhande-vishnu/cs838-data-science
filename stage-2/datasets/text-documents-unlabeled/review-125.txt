At 
 in Astoria, Queens, there is always a pot of pho broth making a low quarrel on the stove, with eddies of marrow from sunken bones. The broth has to hit the eight-hour mark before Lam Lien, the chef, will even consider serving it.
The recipe is his mother’s, described on the menu as “secret,” although the ingredients are traditional: onions, shallots and ginger charred until they evoke volcanic artifacts; spices that blur fragrance and flavor, among them cinnamon, cloves, fennel, star anise, cardamom and coriander; and, once the broth is strained, final anointments of fish sauce and yellow rock sugar, shattered with a hammer.
The secret — according to his son, Michael, who cooks alongside him — is the balance. What arrives at the table is a finely tempered bowl of soup clear but lush on the tongue, with no one flavor lording above the others.
The baseline pho comes with round steak and Angus brisket, poached and cut into tissue-thin strips that shimmy when lifted and practically dissolve on the tongue. If you like, they will add skinny laces of tripe, which yield peaceably to the teeth, and knobs of gelatinous tendon, which do not. The broth is good, delicate and substantial at once, profound without belligerence.
Still, it is but a shadow of the next pho on the list, the same broth transmuted by brisket patted down with five-spice and left to settle overnight, then smoked over wood chips and star anise for six hours. This has strange fathoms, as if you were drinking liquid cloud.
The depth of the pho is something of a surprise at a restaurant whose other offerings seem slightly canted to please American palates. (The menu lists these mostly in English; the use of Vietnamese names can flummox the otherwise adept non-Vietnamese serving staff.)
The balance so carefully monitored in the broth tips, elsewhere, toward the caramel that underlies many Vietnamese dishes. This is distinct from dessert caramel — the sugar is allowed to darken until a few shades shy of black, to bring a counterweight of bitterness. But I was conscious, throughout my meals here, of a commandeering sweetness.
The best dishes favor salt, like shrimp deep-fried in the shell and given a lashing of butter in the wok, or ground lamb shoulder bundled in peppery leaves that the Vietnamese call la lot. These could almost be dolmades; the Liens use lamb instead of the classic beef as a salute to Astoria’s Greek population.
Father and son are attentive to ingredients. Suon nuong is made with a thicker center-cut pork chop, for more texture; smoke and salt leach from generous wedges of bacon into clay-pot rice. Presentation matters, too: Banh mi is deconstructed into a jar of pâté and grilled slices of baguette, with pickled pineapple and mango (from the Pickle Guys on the Lower East Side). Chicken curry, which gets its velvet from coconut milk and a touch of condensed milk, bears a halo of crispy sweet-potato strands.
A sort of barbecued rice-paper pizza, a modern snack by way of Da Lat in the highlands of Vietnam, is still in the tinkering stage. The brittle skin rests under a broken egg, tiny woolly tufts of dried shrimp and pork floss, peanuts, fried shallots, bean sprouts, mango purée and avocado dressing. But something is missing: tang, heat, contradiction.
District Saigon opened in February under the name District Mot, a nod to District 1 in Saigon, where Lam Lien grew up. (The name was recently changed to avoid confusion with the acclaimed District Mot restaurant in Berlin.) The Liens and a partner, Louis Leung, gutted a former 99-cent store and turned it into a sprawling room with a heavy cedar front door, live-edge wood tables and a spray-painted mural of terraced rice paddies.
Written on the back wall is a Vietnamese phrase that translates as “It’s great to be together.” When Lam Lien fled Vietnam in 1979, he was separated from his family, who were given refuge in Toronto. In New York, he worked his way from dishwasher to server to prep cook at the Marriott World Trade Center. After Sept. 11, he joined the kitchen at New Pasteur, a Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown.
His son, now 32, waited tables there while studying finance at Brooklyn College, before opening a Vietnamese restaurant of his own in Hell’s Kitchen. The food there is “very fast,” he said, nothing like the slow broths his father has taught him to make at District Saigon. “I could never do something like this on my own.”
