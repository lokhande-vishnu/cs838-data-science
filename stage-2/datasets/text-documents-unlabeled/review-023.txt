One of the rewards of living in New York is that you can eat at any hour, even if the dollar slice or overstuffed shawarma that was amazing at 4 a.m. doesn’t seem like such a good idea the next day. Beer goggles work on food. And you usually need them for after-midnight eating on the stretch of Macdougal Street where the Indian joint Thelewala opened last month.
But Thelewala is gratifying no matter when you go, or how sober you are.
The lime paneer roll ($4.50) is a play of fatty richness and sharp flavors, the paneer and buttery paratha cut by red onions, coriander and (should you ask for them) minced chiles.
This is street food at its brightest and most fresh. Thelewala is nominally a restaurant — it has a counter, a few stools — but the menu is short (six rolls, three platters, four chaats, no desserts) and cheap (the most expensive item is $8). According to the owner, Shiva Natarajan, whose portfolio of restaurants includes Dhaba and Bhojan, it’s the kind of late-night fare that vendors hawk to idling cars in his native Kolkata (formerly Calcutta).
A chaat like behl pori ($5) translates well. It’s puffed rice tossed with cucumber, red onions, crisped yellow peas, tamarind chutney and mint chutney: a crunchy, soggy, satisfying explosion of sweet and spicy flavors. Jaal mori ($5), puffed rice mixed with peanuts, red onions, lime and kamal namik (black salt), is toned down for New York, and tossed with olive oil. If you want the Kolkata original, ask for it with mustard oil, which gives it a biting, vegetal heat.
Like everything at Thelewala, the chaats are painstakingly made to order. There is no holding pattern here, no steam tables or heat lamps. Order a Thelewala chicken roll ($4.50), and strips of hormone-free chicken are pulled out of a marinade of green chile, cilantro, ginger and garlic, and cooked on the griddle. It’s what you’d expect in the middle of the day; it’s dazzling to find such care and craft at 4 a.m.
