Stopped into the Harrison for dinner; took a table in the bar. Jimmy Bradley, the restaurant’s owner and original chef, had returned to the kitchen after an absence of many years, and replaced the menu developed by Amanda Freitag, who left the restaurant, with his own.
It seemed a good idea to check on his work. Fellow might have lost a step on his game.
Had a shockingly cold and excellent martini. A waiter poured olive oil for the bread service from a distance of about three feet above the table, as if performing a circus trick, and everyone laughed.
The menu was vintage Bradley, modern-American bistro food cooked with a New England accent.
A frisée salad ($11) was excellent, bitter and salty, and it led into some terrific skillet-roasted chicken ($24) with lemon and garlic, with excellent skin and soft, flavorful meat.
And, of course, there was skate ($22). Seared skate wing has been a hallmark of Mr. Bradley’s menus since he opened the Red Cat in Chelsea in 1999. (He served it then with a ruby-red grapefruit emulsion and green olives.)
Now it comes with shaved brussels sprouts, potatoes scented with lemon  and thyme and a duck-bacon broth: a soft, crisp and salty-sweet herbaceous
mixture that pairs  well with weekday evenings and good friends.
All is well at the Harrison.
