HOW often does a 
 make your pulse scurry, keep you up all night? At Foragers City Table, in Chelsea, the culprit is long-fermented 
 leaves, pulverized into a pulp the color of a damp forest floor.
Slightly sour, slightly bitter, it invokes grass, roots and all, with a wild turn toward cabernet sauvignon at the finish. It comes in a ring of condiments — tiny crescents of briny dried shrimp, nutty fried yellow split peas, toasted sesame and sunflower seeds, peanuts and crispy wafers of garlic — around shreds of little gem lettuce, dewy with an emulsion of sesame oil and lime juice. Mix it all up and you have crunch and tang, bright and dark, salt and heat.
The salad, which costs $17, is an adaptation of the Burmese snack laphet thote, which in Yangon goes for about 500 kyat, or 50 cents. (Welcome to the global economy.) It is traditionally made without lettuce, at street stalls where the ingredients are squeezed together with the cook’s bare hands, or served separately in a compartmentalized tray, so you can pinch a little of each.
The approach here is more reverential. On a stark white plate, the elements are arranged symmetrically, like a mandala. Pause a moment to admire the divine geometry. Then demolish it.
Foragers City Table, which opened in April, is an annex to the boutique market Foragers City Grocer. Both are offshoots of Foragers Market in Dumbo, Brooklyn, which subscribes to the credo of local sourcing and sustainability.
The owners — Anna Castellani; her husband, the painter Richard Lamb; and Clifford Shikler, a painter and a photographer — run a 28-acre farm in the Hudson Valley that provides the stores and the restaurant with eggs, herbs and vegetables, some grown, some foraged. Even those fermented tea leaves, imported from Burma, are local in spirit: they come from the family of a Burmese friend of the consulting chef, Douglas Monsalud.
The menu, devised by Mr. Monsalud, who is based in San Francisco, and refined by the on-site chef, Jason Greenberg, cadges seasonings from across Asia. Yuzu kosho, an infernal chile paste with a slug of salt and high, tremulous notes of lemony yuzu zest, is daubed on pudgy raw scallops ($14). Lemon grass perfumes the caramel glazing a Red Wattle porterhouse chop ($30).
Pork crepinettes ($13) are globes of pork sausage, made by the in-house butcher and wrapped in caul fat from a pig’s intestine, which gives them a dark crust and a lush interior. Presented Vietnamese style — with lettuce, chiles and mint for bundling, and nuoc cham, tempered with Meyer lemon, for dunking — they yield potent, gratifying handfuls.
At first a doll-size portion of potato chips ($5) seems ridiculous. But the diaphanous chips, gilded with chicken fat and brushed with yuzu salt, punch above their weight, although they are nearly upstaged by a garnish of flash-fried sage leaves.
Larger-scale dishes falter, like a milquetoast black cod ($29), briefly prodded to life by shards of house-made bacon, and a lamb-belly adobo ($27) over-sloshed with vinegar. Slabs of fried 
 ($17), huddled in an archipelago on a sea of kale, veer into candy land with a black-pepper caramel. This may be just a matter of one chef inheriting the ideas of another and needing time to come into his own.
The dining room is an airy box of polished wood and steel beams, with a shimmering wall of floor-to-ceiling windows. It is handsome, if slightly unspecific: what might happen if West Elm opened a restaurant. You wish it had more dirt under the fingernails.
The adjoining grocery is cozier. How lovely it is, after dinner, to stroll among the shelves, feeling slightly blurry from that shiso gimlet, stocking up on Whimsy & Spice 
 and Madécasse chocolate, blessing all the artisanal vendors in Brooklyn, and the farmers upstate, and the Red Wattle hogs hanging in the butcher’s aging room, and the family in Burma fermenting their tea leaves.
