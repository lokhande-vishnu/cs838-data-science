Churros are the supermodels of the doughnut world: long, skinny and vaguely extraterrestrial. At La Churreria in NoLIta, they come to your table straight from a bath of hot oil ($6 for a half-dozen with 
).
They are moist inside yet dry to the touch, crisp and fluffy and chewy all at once. On their own they are hardly sweet at all. You are supposed to dunk them in the accompanying hot chocolate, which is served in a 
 cup and so dark and thick it almost counts as a pudding.
In Spain, this is breakfast. Also a hangover cure, which may be the same thing.
Other churros are predunked and arrive with a hardened chocolate coat ($2 each). Alas, once entombed, the dough is tough.
La Churreria occupies a narrow storefront next to Socarrat Paella Bar; both monomaniacal operations are run by Jes√∫s Manso, a k a Lolo, a native of Spain. There is room for a takeout counter up front and, in back, a banquette and five marble-top tables.
Elsewhere on the menu are bikinis, dainty triangular sandwiches with crusts cut off ($7.50), an afternoon-tea version of croque monsieur and a reminder that Europeans really know how to snack.
Heftier but still elegant are bocatas, Spanish submarines ($9.50). The best is packed with crunchy calamari loops and pimento-laced aioli; eat it immediately, before sogginess sets in.
There is one more churro to try. It is titanic compared with its willowy sisters, swollen with cream, or dulce de leche, or more of that dark, unnerving chocolate ($3.50). Once bitten, it oozes, smears and precipitates a small ecological disaster. Napkins beyond number will be sacrificed. So be it.
