To properly judge a falafel joint, you must first taste the falafel solo, without the interventions of hummus, tahini or that punch-to-the-gut hot sauce, zhug.
It is a messy business, wrestling a falafel from its burnoose of pita. Kulushkat, mostly a takeout shop that opened in June in Park Slope, offers a sampler of eight craggy chickpea orbs ($4).
Huzzah. The falafel, like the best, is a bundle of contradictions: crisp yet moist, airy yet creamy. Deep-fried until dark gold, it betrays not a glimmer of oil. Fluffiness is all, and these, buoyed by cilantro and spiked with paprika, have bounce.
Beyond the usual classic ($5.50 in a pita) and spicy ($6) versions is the strange and magical Gilly ($6), almost smoky from an infusion of mushrooms. You may never look back. Careful, vegetarians: there is an excellent variation with ground chicken, munificently spiced ($7). Consider the falafel tucked into a freshly baked pita, enveloped in earthy hummus and tahini. Citrus notes seep in from a brisk red cabbage slaw and a slap of tart eggplant.
That last ingredient is so vivid it deserves, and gets, its own sandwich: eggplant à la Yafa ($5.50). Yafa herself may be occasionally spotted in the kitchen, lending a hand to her son, Yagil Kadosh, and Andrew Rowley, Kulushkat’s young, enthusiastic owners. The two met in college, where Mr. Kadosh studied graphic design and Mr. Rowley, cinema. Jobs are hard to come by these days for the artistically inclined. They turned to falafel. It is our gain.
