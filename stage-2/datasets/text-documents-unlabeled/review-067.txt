Buvette

A new spot from the peripatetic chef Jody Williams, Buvette is a miniaturized version of a true Paris cafe: easygoing but with just the right patina of formality. 
It is unrecognizable as the space that housed the Pink Tea Cup for decades. Now it’s all rustic chic, adding pleasure everywhere the eye lands: a linen sack of bread, a basket of walnuts, a wall of wine and cookbooks. 
Buvette is open almost constantly, with bar service and about 10 tables tended by servers in buttoned-up shirts — some of them in waistcoats, yet. These courteous paragons pour 
 from polished pewter pots and discuss the relative virtues of oxtail marmalade and rabbit confit.
Ms. Williams’s purist streak dictates a short menu of cocktails, in plump glass carafes: martinis, manhattans and negronis only ($14).
This effectively keeps local clubgoers away; the crowd is there for the food, like thick slabs of cold butter and anchovies piled on toast ($7). Buvette’s best dishes glisten with fat of all kinds: dairy, olive oil, hazelnut oil, pork — even lentils and kale have trickles of cream stirred in. 
The frequently changing menu is small-plate French bistro with Italian detours. The food, despite an occasional undercooked bean or overcooked tart, was always good and sometimes lovely: a potpie of chicken, rabbit and mushrooms ($12); blue 
 in a pool of honey ($7); oily-soft bread with crisp shreds of bittersweet onion on top (free). A dish of mussels, with parsley, garlic and soft bread crumbs ($10), may be this year’s best mollusks.
Buvette stands for wallowing gracefully in modest luxuries: a well-made omelet, a well-seasoned horseradish cream sauce, a well-balanced chocolate mousse.
