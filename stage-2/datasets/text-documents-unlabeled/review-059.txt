Tap Room 307

307 Third Avenue,

Unless sports TV, excess noise and 20-something dating are your kind of thing, this may not be your kind of place (in the evening, at least).
With 40 drafts and two casks, a room ringed in flat screens and a storefront open to a youthful strip of Third Avenue, Tap Room 307 lures in such an after-work crowd that the kitchen and waiters seem overwhelmed. If your server has the wherewithal to take your order, your pizza might come out under-done, your sausage sliders overdone and your jicama and corn-shoot 
 sans either ingredient.
But day and night here are like, well, day and night. During the sleepy lunch, the food can be wonderful: a snappy fresh kale salad with a creamy lemony dressing; crispy, oblong, wood-fired pizzas dressed in flavorful San Marzano tomato sauce ($10 to $13); orecchiette in a bubbling casserole with a five-cheese punch ($10) and, if you like, crab meat to gild the lily; and a deliciously Dixie-fied Cubano stuffed with house-smoked pork loin and pulled pork ($14). Even when overcooked, the burger ($15), on buttery brioche slathered in melted taleggio and a terrific house-made aioli spiked with garlic, ketchup, sriracha and pickles, is unctuously satisfying.
And, at any hour, the beer is fresh and fascinating. The expertly selected taps include everything from locals like Kelso’s brisk pilsner ($7) to international esoterica like Brouwerij Liefmans Cuvée-Brut ($8), a swarthy Belgian kriek with a macerated cherry tang. Indulge in a beer that’s new to you with each course.
Conclude with hot lemon-blueberry zeppoles ($9), more cakelike than a choux, served with lemon curd and a luscious beer-salted caramel sauce for dipping. Pair it with a snifter of the brand-new Danish import, Evil Twin Yin ($10) . A potent, bittersweet imperial stout, it’s the wicked complement to a dessert that’s very good.
