Trini-Gul, slang for a woman from Trinidad, is a new Caribbean takeout restaurant in a neighborhood filled with them. It’s small, neat and welcoming, decorated with photographs of island scenes, with just a few tables. But it’s worth a detour.
Lines form early for the heady wraps of stew known as roti, and for bake and shark, the classic Trinidadian sandwich of fry bread packed with seasoned fried shark bits, slices of cucumber and drizzles of hot and tamarind sauces, for jerk chicken and fried rice, the whole crazy mash-up of Trinidadian cuisine: Indian, Creole, Chinese, African, Lebanese all at once.
The bake and shark in particular is terrific ($5), both bright and earthy, like a humid, sunny day at Maracas Bay outside of Port of Spain. And there are wonderful doubles ($1.50), the classic Trinidadian street food of curried chickpeas over turmeric-hued fry bread, liberally doused with hot sauce: breakfast in three bites. A rich cook-up of chicken pelau ($5), thick rice stew studded with pigeon peas and bits of dark chicken, is also worth considering. A pair of Bklyn guls eating  with their father devoured a plate of it silently. “I don’t like this pelau,” one said halfway through. “I love it.”
There are small bottles of Coke to drink, fruit juice, a piece of blackened fruitcake for dessert ($1.50). Outside, a billboard rises above Nostrand Avenue, an installation of the Basque artist Itziar Barrio, a tropical scene. “Welcome to the New Paradise,” it reads. “You, a Lonely Wild Cat.” So true!
