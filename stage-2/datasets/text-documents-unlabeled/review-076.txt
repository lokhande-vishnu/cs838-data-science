Chuko is a ramen joint, but its finest dish is a salad.
Mind you, that word does no justice to the lusty combination of raw and tempura kale, mined with golden raisins swollen from pickling, and speared with deep-fried strips of sweet potato ($7). Tangy and crunchy, it is a roguish upgrade of that ’80s warhorse, the “Chinese” chicken salad.
Chuko was opened in August by three veterans of the Japanese-fusion fantasyland Morimoto. They have downsized from 12,000 square feet of glitz in Manhattan to an austere, Swedish-sauna-esque storefront in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.
Their purpose is ramen, but the vegetables, infused with unexpected swagger, command attention. In a mizuna salad, delicate apple and fennel are rudely and delightfully overrun by pork cracklings, bubbled and glistening ($8). Brussels sprouts are crisped and doused with fish sauce ($7).
Less thought-through is a pork banh mi, basically, tonkatsu on a bun, which is not elaborate enough to qualify as a banh mi ($6). A fried-eggplant slider could have used more pickles ($5). Chicken wings are dredged in a peppery batter and fried to high heaven ($7). Of course they’re good. Come on, guys, you could do that in your sleep.
And the ramen? There are three broths: smoky tonkotsu (pork bone); a mix of pork, beef and chicken stocks, to which are added tares (seasoning bases) of rich soy and subtle miso; and vegetarian. You can choose pork or chicken on top ($12 a bowl).
The ingredients are top-notch. The noodles, tailored to each soup, have good tooth. But the broths are callow. They need more time. The best part may be the egg bobbing on top, dark gold yolk just a second past runny.
If it is your lucky night, there will be a ramen special of spicy ground pork and kimchi — fire and fire. My ramen-aficionado companion sniffed: “The kimchi is doing all the work.” Whatever it takes. It made me feel alive.
