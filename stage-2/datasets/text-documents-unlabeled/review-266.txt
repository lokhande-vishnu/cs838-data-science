Gotham Bar and Grill
New American
12 East 12th Street,

IN a city obsessed with the shiny and novel, Gotham Bar and Grill is an outlier. Open since 1984, it celebrates stability and excellence, perhaps even opulence. Fabric chandeliers billow beneath soaring ceilings. Elaborate flowers are everywhere. People dress for dinner and are escorted past marvelous photographs on the way to their tables. It is all very civilized there.
Gotham has an informality of service, though, that is purely American, despite the starched white tablecloths.
And Alfred Portale, who came to this Greenwich Village restaurant the year after it opened, runs a kitchen that is committed to innovation even as it celebrates the past. His life must occasionally resemble those of perpetually touring rock stars who need every night to sing the songs they wrote as teenagers. But even after more than 20 years, new songs keep coming.
A sweet, tomato-flecked 
 with red Maine shrimp, nuggets of bacon and a few artful tangles of wild arugula arrived as an appetizer. The bacon had heft and smoke and fatty crunch, and would not have been out of place at a pop-up restaurant in some corner of Bushwick, Brooklyn, served by a bearish kitchen poet with a rutabaga tattoo on his forearm. It provided a fine complement to the tender flesh of the shrimp, the bite of the greens, the tender, chewy, broth-thickened rice. The combination tasted absolutely of now.
Beside it on the table: Mr. Old School, a thick disk of perfectly diced yellowfin tuna, with Japanese cucumber and shiso leaf, the fish barely dressed in a sweet miso vinaigrette that tingled with ginger. Crouton obelisks rose out of this base, with greens between them: an architectural flourish that has been a highlight of Mr. Portale’s cooking since the start of his career. It was a deeply familiar dish, beautifully rendered: the original article, not a knockoff. It hummed with flavor.
Both dishes were delivered without pretense, with minor, quiet ceremony. A waiter approached and placed them on the table, made sure all was well and departed. He had things to do. At Gotham, there is no recitation of the provenance of the bacon, or explanation of the wild arugula’s journey, before you eat. No one offers the name of the boat whose captain whispered the tuna aboard.
This is refreshing, as it happens. A meal at Gotham is about you and your interests, not of those who made it.
That fact may weigh sometimes on Mr. Portale. Being a success for so long comes with mighty, and surely sometimes boring, responsibilities. (“Five tuna tartares,” a waitress might tell the kitchen at 6, making her first order of the night. Many, many more will follow.) But if this is the case, he does not show it.
Take as an example the restaurant’s seafood 
, a dish that 
 in The New York Times in 1985, when he awarded the restaurant three stars; that Molly O’Neill loved in a 1993 review that gave the same rating; that Ruth Reichl called Mr. Portale’s signature dish in the newspaper’s most recent previous review of the restaurant, in 1996, which also awarded three stars.
That salad is still on the menu, and still seemingly on most of the date-night tables running south along the bar: a molded tangle of scallops, squid, octopus and sweet, briny lobster, swathed by a slice of ripe avocado, dressed simply in lemon and olive oil. The wrap of the avocado is dashing, if no longer really in style. It recalls suits with shoulder pads and hair teased up with 
, Steve Winwood singing “
”
It still tastes terrific, though, with every flavor in balance. It still offers excitement. For those many for whom Gotham is a place to celebrate birthdays, graduations and anniversaries, it needs always to be on the menu, tasting exactly as it does.
None of which is to say Gotham is perfect. The restaurant is very expensive, almost aggressively so, with starters that hover in the mid-$20s and entrees that can go to twice that number, with a wine list that hides its bargains well.
Above the lights is a ceiling that is deeply unattractive, a stucco vision of those ’70s lofts with coffee-can track lighting. And the casual service seems sometimes to be perfunctory, even if it never really lags. (You will always get your water. Sometimes it comes with a splash.) The restaurant does not always show its age well. Some surfaces need fresh paint.
But Mr. Portale does have plenty of new material to showcase. On the current menu, there is an appetizer of cold-smoked Tasmanian sea trout, served with tender baby fennel and celery hearts, with Meyer lemon for acidity and tiny pumpernickel croutons for texture against the firm slickness of the fish. It is unreasonably good. There is another of spring-pea ravioli, luxurious and sweet, with fava beans, delicate pea tendrils and some Parmesan, in a bacon broth of real weight and seriousness — a Greenmarket treat enlivened by a trip to the smokehouse.
He makes shiitake soup with hazelnuts, crème fraîche and aged sherry vinegar. It might be beef consommé and French onion soup and veal yogurt combined into some liquid ambrosia, and a taste of it may serve as complete explanation for all those who do not understand food’s power to make people laugh from pleasure. It is an appetizer that excites and relaxes at once: a pair of velvet slippers for those who order it.
For entrees, Mr. Portale cooks out of a number of larders without ever compromising the integrity of his overall vision. This is a remarkable trick. A single table might have on it a Thai-spiced Maine lobster next to a free-range chicken dusted with the French curry powder known as Vadouvan, with a seared fist of Atlantic halibut with morels and asparagus across the way, next to a dry-aged New York strip steak served with batter-fried Vidalia onion rings.
On the night when that actually happened, each dish tasted absolutely and elaborately true to itself: a celebration of American diversity that avoided melting pots entirely. The lobster stood at attention among sheets of water spinach and shards of crisp snow peas, with ginger root and a pillow of soft rice noodles, in a heady bath of lemongrass broth amplified by kaffir lime. The chicken meanwhile, sweet and perfumed, with perfect skin, tacked toward the north and south coasts of the Mediterranean with layered vegetables, onion confit and preserved lemon, with a potato purée. That halibut, meanwhile, was forager-chic, utterly unfettered in its flavors, with a lick of white wine across its flesh.
And the steak? It came with a marrow-mustard custard of remarkable intensity and a bordelaise you could use to adhere stamps. Only an enormous and enormously delicious dry-aged porterhouse-for-two was better, with a potato gratin, spring onions, sweet English peas, grilled asparagus and more of that bordelaise: British food made by Frenchmen, for Americans to cheer with massive zinfandels, with heady California cabernets.
Speaking of which, care should be taken with the wine list, which contains a lot of these California jam pots at prices to put a sheik back on his heels. Ask for one of the sommeliers, put forward a price and discuss what you are eating and what you like to drink. They know the list, its traps and honey holes. Let them work it to your advantage: they might suggest a nebbiolo instead, at a price you can afford.
“Desserts are intense and very American,” Ms. Reichl wrote of Gotham’s offerings in 1996. This is still the case. Deborah Racicot, the pastry chef, makes a rich and dashing plate of chocolate peanut-butter mousse with dark-chocolate caramel sauce and a raspberry lambic sorbet, and another that is a take on the classic s’more, with a smoked bittersweet chocolate tart, toffee and an excellent quenelle of root-beer 
. There is also a marvelous maple-glazed pineapple cake with hibiscus mint granité and a bourbon-buttermilk ice cream.
It is a crazy-quilt finish to a meal that deserves three cheers.

A  once-modern, now classic take on American haute cuisine in a soaring  dining room filled with celebrants, tourists and regulars.
Moderate but for the occasional chorus of “Happy Birthday” from a table nearby.
