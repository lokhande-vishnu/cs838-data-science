Dickson’s Farmstand Meats
Sandwiches

This butcher shop’s weekday-only lunch menu offers a thoughtful primer on Dickson’s splendid  locally raised beef, lamb, pork and poultry.
The menu (which changes daily, and is posted online) typically features four or five cold sandwiches and three hot items. They may look unfussy, but the supporting ingredients are carefully chosen. Case in point: the terrific pulled pork sandwich ($9) whose drippingly spicy meat, tumbling from its bun, is surmounted by superb crunchy coleslaw. That house-made slaw — which elsewhere could star as a side dish — also cuts through thick saucing on barbecued spareribs and chicken ($12 each).
Likewise, chopped celery and red onion provide helter-skelter contrast for an almost lusciously soft andouille sausage (sandwich, $9). Three fat lamb-and-beef meatballs (sandwich, $10) wear an extra-thick version of the expected red sauce; but almost in secret, the roll is dressed with a blue-cheese spread — a wonderful tangy touch.
Dickson’s chicken 
 sandwich ($6) is a revelation, as much as chicken salad can be, sprightly with carrots, celery, purple cabbage, capers, pepper and a touch of vinegar. No goo, but still you might lick your fingers.
Similar deft touches are applied to other cold sandwiches: butter and cornichons for ham ($7), red onion and mayo for roast beef ($8). Since cold sandwiches are prepared in advance, however, there’s no way to order pastrami with mustard ($8) and hold the slaw.
Dickson’s is single-minded about meat, in a good-natured, enthusiastic way. Unsurprisingly, there are no vegetarian options, but also no drinks or dessert; all are plentiful elsewhere in Chelsea Market. Seats are harder to come by, but the High Line is only steps away.
