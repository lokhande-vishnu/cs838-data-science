Cochinita opened last May on a grubby stretch of Fulton Street  in Brooklyn, and in less than two months was shuttered by a fire. Adam Frank, the owner, is a former Angeleno who, like many of his kind in New York, pined for the good, cheap Mexican food of his hometown. He vowed to rebuild.
Call it the little taqueria that could. In December, Cochinita reopened, its aesthetic unchanged: red metal chairs, angular black banquettes, sky-blue walls. Gone, thankfully, are the fussy checklists and tiny pencils customers once had to use to identify their choice of condiments. Now you simply speak your order.
If the only taco on the menu were the cochinita pibil ($3.50), that would be enough to justify Cochinita’s existence. Pork shoulder is steeped in a marinade of peppery achiote and sour orange, folded in banana leaves, then slow-roasted until it practically shreds itself. You get a generous mound, trimmed with pickled red onions, a snowfall of Cotija cheese, salsa and, in a corner, the essential triangle of lime. A base of two soft corn tortillas keeps the juices from running over.
The other taco fillings are meeker, as if someone had pressed the mute button. (The exception is the pugilistic chorizo, an occasional special.) A pity, since the ingredients are sound: humanely raised meats and chewy tortillas made with fresh-ground corn masa from Tortilleria Nixtamal in Queens.
This is Brooklyn, so the packaging is compostable. For dessert, flan soaked in caramel syrup ($3.75) comes in a  jelly jar that you can take home (to  put up  foraged berries, of course).
It is hard not to root for Mr. Frank, who seems to genuinely listen to customers. A small request, then: more chiles all around. Just because you’ve been burned once, don’t be afraid of fire.
