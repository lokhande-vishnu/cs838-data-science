Wo Hop

It was early evening at Wo Hop, the dinner rush still just over the horizon, and the waiters lounged at tables in their work jackets, waiting. They looked as if they were ready to play cards. Everywhere were snapshots and business cards, tacked to the walls.
“Sit here,” one said, pointing to a table, fanning out napkins, glasses of water, forks. You can probably get chopsticks at Wo Hop, but it would take a while for someone to locate the box. “You want a beer?”
Wo Hop is down a flight of stairs at 17 Mott Street, and has been since 1938. It is what New Yorkers used to know as a Chinese restaurant, serving an Americanized version of Chinese food, an authentic taste of an inauthentic past. You will find no cumin lamb from Sichuan, no soup from Yunan. Wo Hop predates the arrival in New York of all other Chinese cuisines.
The dumplings ($5.30) are deep-fried, the color of mahogany, pillowy soft inside.  Duck lo mein ($4.95)  is slick with soy and tastes smoky, unhealthy, and deeply of duck. They have a lot of what in Chinese cuisine is known as the “breath of the wok.” This is the taste created by stir-frying in an extremely hot wok. At Wo Hop, the breath might be that of an endearing hobo, full of pipe tobacco and sweet wine.
From the menu’s “Oriental Specialties” comes 
 Cantonese ($18.95), cut into pieces with the shell still on, in a bath of white sauce thickened with cornstarch and pork. The lobster is sweeter than you might imagine. So is the sauce. Shower it with hot sauce and soy.
Do the same with egg foo young ($6.75 to $7.95), onions, eggs and strips of pork scrambled below a fondant of brown sauce. Eat clams with black bean sauce ($11.25) over a bowl of white rice. There is great comfort in eating such food, at a restaurant with seven decades in Manhattan, still going strong.
