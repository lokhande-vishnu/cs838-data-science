They are still coming out, the young and ambitious and well dressed, the older, scuff-heeled artist set, gesso-stained Brooklyn strivers and models out of Grenoble alike. They sit along the banquettes up front and laugh, or sulk beneath Larry Clark pictures and preen in the back, or stare longingly at the giant Martin Schreiber print, a larger-than-life red-headed nude who everyone says may be Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. She lies on a couch. She’s a glass of grenache.
This is Raoul’s, a Prince Street mainstay since the mid-1970s. It’s Paris in New York, Berlin’s Paris Bar in SoHo, a taste of the Manhattan found in Sondheim lyrics.
Raoul’s is the place people are looking for when they walk off the campus at State for the last time and make the move east. Steak frites and a vin rouge can — just like that — become the taste of home.
So maybe tuna tartare with olives, drizzled with anchovy vinaigrette, isn’t quite a loft-law classic. The Raoul’s bread is still perfect, a baguette out of the French national dictionary, with butter to match, neither too cold nor too warm. So perhaps roasted veal sweetbreads with cauliflower and a raisin emulsion is a dispatch from Crazytown. The frisée 
 with lardons of bacon and a poached duck egg makes up for it in spades, still exactly the right introduction to the tender steak au poivre and thatch of crisp, golden fries.
And if there’s pomegranate syrup with the foie gras, that’s fine with the Citroën set, circa 2010. It leads quite nicely into a rack of lamb that nods at North Africa with its sides of merguez, grape leaves and eggplant purée. Even classics deserve a chance at new pals.
Dessert? Another bottle of this and we’re up the spiral staircase to sleep.
