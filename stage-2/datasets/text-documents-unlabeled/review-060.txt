Though you can get a great steak in Brooklyn, until now if you lived in Park Slope, that steak might as well have been in Timbuktu.
With the opening of the Benchmark Restaurant, that long commute to the “other Brooklyn” can come to an end.
In fact, if you’re seeking steak for two, Benchmark beats a place like Peter Luger by a mile for a date.
Its pretty brick dining room is set back from the street, fronted by a long charming garden filled with tables and plantings.
When ordering, avoid the overwrought appetizers — dishes like veal sweetbreads ($9) on a roasted eggplant-and-vanilla purée with bacon broth and pickled red onions clash with themselves and will clash with your palate.
Cut straight to the 24-ounce bone-in rib-eye ($30). Pasture-raised, corn-finished and wet-aged, it is charred just so; it’s crusty, juicy and just plain delicious.
Side it with fresh-creamed spinach and hand-cut fries with a tangy, smoky chipotle ketchup ($6 each), and you and your beau will dine harmoniously.
You can pitch the woo over the wagyu, too ($22); this demure block of beef is appropriately tender.
And the broiled bone-in New York strip ($29), full of flavor from its rich marbling, pairs beautifully with cabernets, from the silky 2007 Château Pascaud ($40) to the 2005 Far Niente, a jammy blockbuster that tops out the list at $150.
Skip the veal chop ($26); though massive, it’s wan, while the overly sweet brioche bun makes the burger ($13) taste like dessert.
As for the actual desserts ($8 each), the grapefruit and honey cheesecake with ginger sorbet, like the best dates themselves, has just the right balance of sweet, spice and pucker.
