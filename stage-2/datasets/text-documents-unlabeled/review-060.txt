Ca Va Todd English



The biography of the chef Todd English, as it is written on the Web site of his new restaurant, Ça Va Todd English, proclaims him a “celebrity chef,” and a “restaurateur, author, entrepreneur, and television star based in Boston, Massachusetts, and New York City.” This tells you all you need to know about Ça Va, which sits off a hotel lobby, attached to both a friendly bar and a crowded market-cafe. Mr. English’s celebrity is the first and most important part of Ça Va Todd English.
It sure isn’t the food. The restaurant is a brasserie, which means the menu is vaguely French in aspect, more cosmopolitan than the vaguely Mediterranean fare that first brought Mr. English fame at Olives in Charlestown, Mass., and which led in turn to pizzerias and television, Las Vegas and the running of the food court of the Plaza hotel, among other places. And so there is a frisée aux lardons 
 ($12) that would disappoint even on a cheap international flight, and a grim, metallic onion soup ($8) with a piece of toast briefly introduced to some Gruyère. There is a dish called Ça Va steak frites ($25), a “charred” flatiron steak with the texture and flavor of a bound collection of Ibsen rescued from a house fire. And a Monday special of “crispy rabbit” ($28) that matched its description exactly: its dark, almost burned crust shattering open to reveal meat of nondescript flavor.
The bar, though? Comfortable seats, decent wines by the glass. Ça va.
