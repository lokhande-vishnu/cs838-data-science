New Yorkers in need of an exuberant dose of Russian surrealism usually head to one of the velvet-and-gold restaurants by Brighton Beach where the entertainers wear sequins and the customers furs, where the band plays pop songs in 12 languages and even those who shouldn’t be on the dance floor get out there and shake it, where you lose track of how many bottles of vodka have slammed on the table.
Onegin, brought to life this fall on Avenue of the Americas in Greenwich Village, is exactly like one of those restaurants, except without the sequins, without the furs, without the band and without the dance floor. It doesn’t even seem to have much vodka on hand. Over the course of an evening, our table managed to persuade our server to bring us one shot per person which, at a Russian restaurant, is the same thing as drinking water all night.
Take away all the reasons one goes to Brighton Beach, and there’s not much left. Onegin has some elaborate ceiling paintings on the theme of Pushkin and a fine collection of brocade armchairs. Oh, and it has some food.
A disheveled assortment of smoked fish looked as if it had been sliced with hedge clippers and dropped on the plate from a great height. A filet of sturgeon was cooked until it had the consistency of cube steak, then splashed with red currant glaze that might have been a reduction of melted lollipops. Every main course came with the same collection of summer squash, asparagus, red and yellow peppers and broccoli — all grilled, at one point, and now cold. It was like going to a wedding reception where the caterers had been told minutes before dinner that they weren’t going to be paid.
Manhattan has a growing population of first- and second-generation Russians with money to spend on pelmeni and other tastes of the motherland. One day, they’ll get the restaurant they deserve.
