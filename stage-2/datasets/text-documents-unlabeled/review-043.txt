During lunch rush, Onya Japanese Restaurant functions like a fast food joint. Order, sit, slurp and be back at your desk before your computer logs you off.
The efficiency plays well in Midtown, but the pace obscures the craft that goes into each bowl. The udon are made fresh with Japanese flour and cooked until koshi — the supple yet elastic texture of the ideal noodle.
Your first visit, start with the sanuki kake udon ($4.95 for medium), a simple dish of noodles in broth. Sanuki is a thick style of udon from Kagawa Prefecture. It is as firm and silky as a hard-boiled egg white. A few pieces of tempura ($1.75 for one piece, $2 for two) from under a heat lamp can round out the meal. Shrimp and 
 are great; the whole egg, not so good.
Regulars order from memory: niku udon ($7.95 for medium), crowned with thin slices of beef, or curry udon ($7.95 for medium), with its viscous broth. Or they opt for more challenging choices. Ground pork and miso udon ($9 for medium) is cold, sweet and meaty, a combination that isn’t for everybody. The same is true for the bukkake udon ($6.95), smothered with yam foam and cod roe, though some seem to enjoy the gluey texture. The restaurant is from the company behind the Beard Papa cream puff chain, but there isn’t much dessert.
The mood changes at night, when there are waiters, flattering lighting and cocktails. Udon is still the star, but there are more role-players — pickled mackerel charred with a blowtorch ($7.50), freshly made 
 ($5). It’s not unpleasant at that hour, but it doesn’t feel quite right. Better to stick with lunch, when the pleasures of a bowl of fresh udon, devoured under the skylight in the back, might be the best part of your workday.
