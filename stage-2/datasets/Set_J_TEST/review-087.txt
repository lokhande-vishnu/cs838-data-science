Recette
New American, Spanish
328 West 12th Street ,
212-414-3000
A GRAND parade streams along the West Village sidewalks, corner of 12th and Greenwich Streets, crossroads of a particular world. There are dog-walking flâneurs; Westbeth pensioners; the young and desperate en route to the meat markets of the meatpacking district a few blocks north. Here are cabs stopping to let out real housewives. There are young professionals walking home to small apartments filled with books.
There is a restaurant, too, Recette. Jesse Schenker opened it a few months ago in the space that used to be Jarnac. It is small and crowded behind its windows, loud in the way that little Village restaurants can become loud, the sort of place men go wearing blazers, then pull them off halfway through the meal, where women flush and everyone leans into the table to talk.
Mr. Schenker is 27, bearded, wildly tattooed, with time spent in Gordon Ramsay’s kitchen. For a while last year he ran Recette out of a Harlem bakery as a kind of private supper club, along with Christina Lee, his pastry chef. (Ms. Lee has bona fides of her own; she cooked at Per Se.) Now they’ve come downtown to go big: American food with Spanish flavors, cooked with French technique; small plates, high concept.
The menu has a note at its top explaining that it was “designed for you to construct your meal in accordance to your appetite  — from one plate to a venturesome tasting.” This reads like something you might hear some poor sap say on television, serving six courses of three-bite plates to a judicial panel of restaurant hacks and dour comedians. Small plates, if you’re not  drinking sherry in Barcelona, rarely satisfy. What once were tapas are now things served on the Food Network.
As in Chelsea galleries, though, perhaps so too in West Village kitchens: The artists who make the work are rarely the people who ought to explain it. The cooking at Recette is smart and imaginative, the food that results from it elegant and full of flavor. (The plates aren’t even that small.)
The wine list is deep and the service friendly and able, if sometimes overwhelmed. You may have to ask for water a couple of times. There will be the occasional crash of a dropped wineglass. It is casual, almost to a fault. But Recette is a very good restaurant.
Snacks, in the restaurant’s parlance, should start your meal. Order them the moment you sit, along with a glass of the restaurant’s excellent  grüner  veltliner, a 2003 Hirsch that has some character to it. You’ll want a platter of the restaurant’s cured and potted meats as well, along with some codfish fritters and a serving of cannellini beans with chorizo and white anchovy.
The charcuterie plate offers slices of the small and peppery salami known as <dish>cacciatore</dish> and some melting sheets of <dish>Bayonne ham</dish> (air-dried in France, not New Jersey). These are unimpeachable. But Mr. Schenker’s <dish>foie gras terrine</dish> is revelatory, a single slice revealing a kind of glistening mosaic, perfect in its form, each lobe of the liver unmolested by the process: luscious, creamy, with a faint mineral tang. It’s a meat painting, an organ sculpture; like most complicated French cooking, it tastes utterly complete, perfect in the way a ripe strawberry is, or a fresh-shucked oyster.
In that, the terrine plays ingénue to Mr. Schenker’s <dish>tête de cochon</dish>, also on the plate, a rough-hewn and big-flavored head cheese. There is some grainy mustard with it, a few sweetly pickled vegetables. These act as rings and scarves and kohl do for Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. They elevate toughness to beauty.
The <dish>codfish fritters</dish> come beneath a drizzle of curried aioli, bright and lemony, and above a few tablespoons of fiery lamb-sausage ragù. This is a head-scratchingly good combination. You may wish for a double order, though the <dish>fish ’n’ meat</dish> combination is revisited with those soft white cannellini beans in their porky chorizo sauce, beneath anchovy hats. Brightness and fire combine again in the presence of acidity. Some more of that grüner would be nice with this.
There aren’t really appetizers beyond the snacks, or main dishes. There is a short list of plates of various sizes, all ambitious in design and execution; the menu is remarkably free of stuff that’s available everywhere else.
On the smaller, lighter end, a spring evening might suggest a 
 of <dish>peppery wild arugula<.dish>, with kumquats, mint, lemon, hazelnuts and a few shavings of <dish>ricotta salata</dish> for salt and creaminess. There is also an excellent little cigar of <dish>duck carpaccio</dish> wrapped around <dish>chicken liver mousse</dish>, accompanied by crisp apple and fragrant thyme.
<dish>Pork belly</dish>, cooked with a sherry-laced caramel, with rock shrimp and roasted baby turnips, arrives alongside a spat of almondy, piquillo-fired <dish>romesco sauce</dish>. It’s terrific: Spain on a plate, as seen from Manhattan. And even the offal-phobic may be converted by a <dish>sweetbread fried crisp</dish> and to a melting interior, served with brown butter sauce studded with capers and dressed with lemon and parsley, aside some wilted escarole. It hits the flavor stations hard: salty and sweet, with an acidic bite at the end.
Mr. Schenker’s <dish>ocean trout</dish> is sweetly nutty beneath its crisp skin, with an earthy dressing of smoked bacon and savoy cabbage, bluefoot mushrooms and a foam of emulsified shellfish broth that’s dated enough to be cheeky. It tastes of high tide and the sun. Pair it with a <dish>golden baby chicken</dish> served with soft grits and a rough mustard soubise. This makes for hearty eating and a strong case for more grits in your life besides.
(Those obsessed with portion size will either rush toward or avoid entirely a single <dish>roasted scallop</dish> served with a smidgen of <dish>braised oxtail</dish>, earthy morels and a green-garlic purée, as in the Pacific Northwest. It’s phenomenally good, but you could eat it in perhaps two bites.)
Ms. Lee, meanwhile, waits in the wings with her showstoppers. A <dish>roasted apple napoleon</dish> is one, served with caramel 
 and a nearly savory Earl Grey milk jam. A <dish>deconstructed s’more</dish> that looks like an Elizabeth Peyton canvas is another, with graham-cracker ice cream, toasted marshmallow cream and a knife-cut of cayenne-hyped milk-chocolate ganache.
This is what Girl Scouts taste camping, and what they spend the rest of their lives looking for at the end of meals. Ms. Lee and Mr. Schenker are going to be around for a while.
