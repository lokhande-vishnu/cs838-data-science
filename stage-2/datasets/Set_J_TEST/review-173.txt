DOESN’T your heart sink a little when you hear the words “Here’s a little something from the chef”?
I know I’m ungrateful, but when I find myself spooning sunchoke froth from a demitasse I wonder why
the chef couldn’t send out a little something I actually want, like six cold oysters or a nice
sausage. Dan Silverman, the chef at the Standard Grill in the meatpacking district, does not make
that mistake. At dinner, as the main courses are being set down, he sends out a cast-iron platter of
<dish>fried potatoes dressed with pimentón mayonnaise</dish>, his spin on patatas bravas, the tapas bar classic.
Crisp, smoky, spicy and very hard to resist, this little something rounds out the meal rather than
slowing it down. Small grace notes like this have helped the Standard Grill play to robust crowds
since it opened three months ago. It is not the place I would send friends who want to study the
latest contortions of the   masters of haute cuisine. But it is exactly where I would direct anybody
who needs to recharge by plugging straight into the abundant, renewable energy source that is
downtown Manhattan. This was not a foregone conclusion when Mr. Silverman teamed up with the
Standard Grill’s owner,  . Mr. Balazs operates remorselessly stylish hotels in California, New York
and Florida, and with them, a number of restaurants. Yet none of them really established Mr. Balazs
as a restaurateur. The Standard Grill, adjoining his Standard Hotel, does. The rambling menu doesn’t
always cohere, and the waiters can be unequal to their jobs, but somehow none of that matters much.
The pair had the great luck to open their restaurant just under the High Line and the good sense to
know what to do there. A location beneath a disused railroad trestle is not an automatic ticket to
success. But this trestle has been transformed into a pedestrian park that is one of the most
exciting promenades in the city, and the design of the Standard Grill taps this excitement. Windows
in the dining room look north and south, taking in the steel underbelly of the High Line and the
endless human circus of the walkers drawn to it. Few of them will end their stroll with a meal at
the Standard Grill, unless they booked well ahead. Those who did, and who survive the line at the
host’s pulpit to be granted entrance to the inner dining room, find themselves in a handsome,
big-city space that invokes either the Grand Central Oyster Bar or, less romantically, a subway
platform at rush hour. The tiled, barrel-vaulted ceiling makes for treacherous acoustics. At times
conversations across the room are beamed directly to your table. Sitting by the open kitchen one
night, we heard an expediter shouting out orders as if he were communicating with cooks in Jersey
City. With 100 seats in this room, another 100 in an even noisier antechamber, and 85 more on the
sidewalk, it is a marvel that the kitchen reliably bangs out solid, flavorful food. Mr. Silverman, a
veteran of Lever House, Alison on Dominick Street and Union Square Cafe, may be overqualified for
cooking at a mess hall. But, as in archery, high-volume restaurants must aim above the bull’s-eye to
allow for the effect of gravity. Like the potatoes, some of the best dishes show the chef’s fluency
with ingredients from Spain. Their casual integration alongside French and Italian ideas on the menu
is vivid testimony that Spanish cuisine has entered New York’s vernacular. Wax beans often leave me
wanting something more, and Mr. Silverman provides it, tossing them with miniature coins of chorizo.
I sank my spoon with pleasure into a velvety white gazpacho, although I wished it hadn’t been
garnished so freely with onions, grapes, cherry  , cucumbers and almonds that it threatened to
become more salad than soup. It was not the only item that seemed to suffer some kind of identity
disorder. A vegetable plate with wild mushrooms, corn and <dish>airy herb dumplings</dish> came with plenty of
broth, but not the soup spoon it needed. And, like the sweet, tender <dish>ravioli of peas</dish> served with
pistachios and mint, it was sold as an entree, but ate more like an appetizer, in portions that were
put to shame beside a generous plank of <dish>grilled trout or a fillet</dish> of swordfish grilled, like tuna,
to a flattering medium rare. We did ask for a spoon, and our server responded with a quick and
chipper, “Absolutely!” Her smile went a long way, as did the good cheer of most of the staff, in
making up for frequent wobbles. An iceberg wedge was ordered as a side dish but showed up just
before desserts. Espresso arrived without sugar, and empty cocktail glasses hung around on the table
until the check was paid. What is billed as “million dollar” roasted chicken for two cost $32 and
occasioned a service failure you wouldn’t expect if you were paying 99 cents. The <dish>chicken</dish> was set
down before me in a cast-iron skillet. I did not get a plate, nor did the friend who was sharing it
with me until he spoke up, and then he was given one scaled for an appetizer. We didn’t blame the
overwhelmed waiter, but we did want to wrap him in a warm blanket and pack him into a cab with the
names of a few restaurants that give the staff more than 30 seconds of training before sending them
into battle. The place is full of small oddities: the restrooms that look unisex, but aren’t; the
disc jockey in a glass booth whose tunes don’t play in the dining room; the very good chocolate
mousse that you are meant to eat with a big rubber spatula. Does any of this make sense? No. Does
it, against the odds, add up to a worthwhile restaurant? Absolutely.
