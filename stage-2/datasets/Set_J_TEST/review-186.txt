Expectations are everything. It was hard to know what to expect when  , the British-born chef who
has been New York’s chief importer of the gastro-pub ethos since she opened  , announced that her
latest project would be called Salvation Taco. Although she consulted with the chef of two local
Mexican restaurants, Roberto Santibañez, it seemed likely that Mexican tradition would not be
treated as law. But when a restaurant has two words in its name and one of them is taco, you might
think the star attraction will be a fat bundle of something hot and tasty folded inside a warm
tortilla with a sauce that adds intrigue and excitement. That describes almost none of the tacos I
ate at this jammed and noisy five-month-old restaurant inside the Pod 39 hotel in Murray Hill. The
tortillas were a little bigger than an English muffin. A small taco can be a great taco, but these
were topped so minimally and sauced so timidly that masa was virtually all I could taste. A swipe of
curried crema was not enough to bring four tiny and stubbornly bland cauliflower florets to life. A
relish of charred onions and pomegranate molasses might have lifted two little fried sweetbreads out
of dullness if there had been more than a small blotch of it. Those tiny portions cooled quickly.
Often the fillings were cold, the tortillas going stiff, a shame because they are freshly pressed
and griddled. Even the miniature naan that stood in for a tortilla in one taco was so firm one day
that it was unbendable, although on another it folded obediently around chunks of spiced lamb.
Stacked in a covered basket, though, Salvation’s masa tortillas are tender, warm and seductively
fragrant. This is how they are served if you order one of the “family-style feasts,” impressive
platters of protein that you tear apart and pile into tacos yourself. Two of these were spectacular:
the <dish>ham hock</dish>, with a fruity and tart chile-tamarind glaze; and the cumin and pepper-rubbed lamb
shoulder, so intensely flavorful it was as if three lambs had been distilled down to a single
super-lamb. Rolling your own will get you a terrific taco, but some of the tables are so narrow it’s
a bit like performing surgery on an airplane seatback tray. Ken Friedman, Ms. Bloomfield’s business
partner in Salvation Taco (as well as the Spotted Pig, the   Oyster Bar and  ), has gone for a
psychedelic, polytheistic thrift-store look, filling two rooms with Japanese lanterns, glass
Buddhas, Hindu gods, Christian saints and a painting of a cowboy angel by the Rev. Howard Finster.
At least it supplied some visual distractions on a Friday night when a promised 90-minute wait for a
table stretched to two hours. Dishes that seemed out of place in a taqueria often had a good reason
for being there, including the <dish>fried pig ears</dish> sprinkled with ground chiles; a soup of <dish>kimchi</dish>, <dish>pork
and hominy</dish> with the hot-and-sour potency of some <dish>Sichuan stews</dish>; and the dark, terrifically complex
<dish>beef chili</dish>, long on the fruity flavor of dried chile peppers if somewhat short on meat. But the
things you’d hope any taqueria would nail could be dispiriting. Guacamole was sensationally well
seasoned with lime and serranos, but always arrived cold. Margaritas were strangely flat, a mariachi
band without trumpets. An al pastor quesadilla needed more heat, more cheese and, crucially, any
amount of pineapple, which was missing entirely. At least two-thirds of the white cubes in a ceviche
turned out to be not fish but apples. There is also a lamb tongue sandwich that the menu calls a
<dish>torta</dish>. It had the bread you’d expect, a bulkie roll dabbed with refried beans, but none of the
trimmings: no lettuce, tomatoes, onions or mayonnaise. The tongue, poached and grilled, was
wonderfully done, and so was the chimichurri of raw herbs, lime and olive oil. The only thing the
sandwich needed was the <dish>crusty Italian roll</dish> that Ms. Bloomfield might have chosen if Salvation Taco
was not supposed to be a Mexican restaurant. To redraw my taco baseline, I went to the Bronx. At
Taqueria Tlaxcalli in the Parkchester neighborhood, I found <dish>golden gorditas</dish>, flying saucers of fried
masa filled with a crunchy mash of chicharrones. These little pork puffs make impressively complex
snacks with the addition of a cooked tomato salsa that had almost as much smoke as heat. I found
hand-pinched sopes filled with refried beans and crumbled chorizo browned to a heavy-duty crackle
that was softened by cilantro, onions, fresh cheese and crema. I found a crisp, citrusy and spicy
cactus salad that was a model of unpretentious salad craftsmanship, and a torta constructed to
maximize the collisions of warm and cool, crunchy and soft that are the source of the sandwich’s
charms. I found juicy <dish>fajitas</dish> and even juicier alambres, a stir-fry of meat, green peppers and
onions under a poof of melted queso Oaxaca and four folded tortillas. And I found tacos that filled
out their warm corn tortillas the way a fat man fills out a hammock. The meats were canonical: al
pastor bright red with chiles and topped with pineapple; tender barbacoa to make a convert out of
goat skeptics; and deeply savory carnitas that were somehow both creamy and crunchy.
