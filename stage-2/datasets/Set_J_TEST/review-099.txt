After looking over the menu at 
, the woman at the end of the counter made an announcement that would turn out to be catastrophic for her dinner plans.
“I’m allergic to fried food,” she said.
She was in trouble, and not just because she may have been the first person in medical history with an allergy to a cooking technique. Somehow she had wandered into a new restaurant serving no-choice, two-hour-long menus that climax with a volley of vegetables and seafood, swished around in batter and sent to a pan of hot oil for a final swim.
The white-oak counter where she was sitting, in fact, is bent like an elbow to give all nine chairs around it a view of that oil. Above the pan stood Masao Matsui, who has been frying tempura at one place or another since 1968. 
, the Japanese-based restaurant group, built this serene cloister on East 39th Street for, and named it after, this man.
Dinner at 
 with nothing fried? Asking 
 for a plate of <dish>seasonal organic vegetables</dish> would make more sense.
After a brief conference with the staff (“You can’t just do some <dish>sushi</dish> and <dish>sashimi</dish>?” her date asked), she was off to eat somewhere else. I stayed to see whether the <dish>tempura</dish> is special enough to build a $200 menu around it.
Following the traditional order of kaiseki meals, dinner this September night got off to a light start: a small glass of <dish>dashi</dish> with spinach and bits of matsutake mushrooms, just coming into season on that week. When they were gone, I knocked back the dashi. It was cool, clear and very delicious.
The server said that what came next was a bowl of <dish>tofu</dish>. My tongue said it was my destiny, the fulfillment of my earthly desires, or at least all the ones that can conceivably be fulfilled by <dish>bean curd</dish>. Eating it was like spooning up the densest top layer from the neck of a bottle of pure cream. For a few minutes, everything else went away and we were alone, the <dish>tofu</dish> and I, floating together in a void somewhere.
O.K., 
 Three little appetizers, the best being two pieces of <dish>anago sushi</dish> about the size of Chiclets, snapped me back to the normal world. The <dish>sashimi</dish> that arrived next may have been a little too normal. The <dish>tuna belly</dish> was definitely too cold by a couple of degrees, and while the <dish>squid</dish> was exceptionally sweet and the <dish>fluke</dish> very firm, the ensemble seemed a bit unimaginative for a kaiseki meal costing this much.
Then servers ducked in from the wings and moved the scenery into position for the next act, the tempura. There was a square dish for pink miso salt. Another for white salt scraped from a large solid crystal behind the counter that looks as if it will last 1,000 years. Dipping sauce came in a ceramic bowl, shaped by hand and stamped all over with stars or asterisks. A dish next to it held grated daikon, and a spoon for mixing it into the sauce. Finally, there was a squeezer just big enough for a lemon wedge. Martha Stewart has eaten at Tempura Matsui a few times since it opened in July. I’ll bet she thought about pocketing this lemon squeezer.
Then, on yet another dish, was a sheet of crisply folded white paper. It is for blotting up any oil that runs off the tempura’s crust. On this night, there wasn’t going to be any.
Mr. Matsui skimmed stray dribbles of batter from the pan, looked up, smiled. A few weeks after Tempura Matsui opened, an undisclosed personal matter had recalled him to Japan. Shin Kato, who was 18 when he began to study the ways of the shimmering oil at Mr. Matsui’s side, took over. Now they share the chef title. On this night, Mr. Matsui happened to be in town and was at his station, looking loose and relaxed, like Dizzy Gillespie waiting to take a solo.
Two fried heads of <dish>Japanese tiger shrimp</dish> were placed on the paper, spidery pink antennas and maxillipeds angling out in all directions. They were extraordinary, like eating <dish>potato chips</dish> at first, then like tasting a plate of <dish>shrimp</dish> that had been concentrated down to a single bite.
The rest of the beast showed up next, slender bodies and trimmed, edible tails in a see-through veil of batter. Mr. Matsui is a minimalist fryer. His coating was less shell than skin, and he heated it just enough to give it a golden blush. The shrimp were dizzily tender and heavy with their own sweetness. So was the fat <dish>Pacific oyster</dish> that came along a few minutes later: Warmed but not cooked, it gave up a rush of rich oceanic juices and tasted a bit like cucumber. By the time I tasted the <dish>nori-wrapped and fried scallop</dish>, still pink at the center, I was convinced that this was one of the most exciting meals I’d had this year.
The exhilaration of that night was not as intense on later visits. Even that first time, I wondered about the <dish>tempura asparagus</dish>. Did Mr. Matsui have a special farmer who grew delicious asparagus in September? He did not. Neither did Mr. Kato, who was serving asparagus when he was back behind the pan again in October. I doubted a tempura chef in Japan would bother frying asparagus when pumpkin was in season.
I never warmed up to the <dish>crunchy onion half both</dish> chefs served, either. And while Mr. Matsui fried a <dish>Japanese eggplant</dish> to a puddinglike sweetness, Mr. Kato’s eggplant was not as softly thrilling. His seafood choices at my last meal — two species of <dish>eel</dish> and a flaky Japanese <dish>whiting</dish> — were very fine but a little monotonous.
There were eight kinds of tempura at each of my meals. Apparently, some customers expected more fried food from a tempura specialist, so the restaurant recently increased the number. I never wanted more tempura, though; I wanted more interesting tempura.
After a funny little salad to wipe the palate clean — Mr. Matsui’s had <dish>seaweed with grapes</dish>, while Mr. Kato’s grapes came with pickled mushrooms and vinegared apple pulp — came a dish I could eat once a week, a fritter of cut-up shrimp over excellent short-grain rice. At Tempura Matsui, it is served with pickles and a really terrific <dish>miso soup</dish>. For dessert, I was very happy about <dish>soybean jelly</dish> with a dark-brown sugar syrup, less enthralled with the <dish>grapefruit-flavored Bavarian cream</dish>.
Experiencing tempura as a serious craft is a thrill, but Mr. Matsui’s style ensures that almost all the pleasure comes from whatever is being cooked inside that diaphanously thin batter. How many people will pay $200 for <dish>fried asparagus</dish> in fall when we can eat a kaiseki meal with a greater range of truly special seasonal ingredients at, say, 
 or 
? Tempura Matsui’s chefs and owners may be underestimating New Yorkers. Many of us are free of fried-food allergies, and ready for an adventure.
