IS it worth it?
This is the question that has attended Masa, the stupendously expensive <dish>sushi</dish> emporium in the Time Warner Center, ever since it opened in 2004. The food at the restaurant is exceptional, offering tastes and preparations that can be unforgettable.
Take one bite of expertly diced, top-grade fatty bluefin tuna tartare cloaked in an equal measure of osetra caviar and discover a central truth: Masa, owned and operated by the chef Masayoshi Takayama, is one of New York’s peak culinary indulgences.
That bite comes at some cost. Seven years ago, <dish>Masa</dish> had a base price of $300 a person, excluding tax, tip and upgrades like something to drink. Now it is $450 for the same fandango, an increase of 50 percent. A meal for two at the restaurant can easily run to $1,500 — an amount that is a little more than 35 percent of the Census Bureau’s most recent calculation of the median monthly household income in the United States.
The relationships between cost and quality, experience and service have always been sticky ones for those who spend their time and money in restaurants, particularly in New York. Here are the best dumplings you may ever eat outside of China, five for $1. Over there, a <dish>steak</dish> to blow the mind of the biggest hat in Texas: it costs $190 for two people. One expensive restaurant has ironed tablecloths and nearly obsequious service. Another has placemats and plays the music of the Doobie Brothers, and loudly, too. How do we make sense of the differences among all these? Can that sense be quantified?
I went to Masa to explore those questions, in meals eaten over the course of more than 12 months, first in the spare, quiet dining room and later at the wide and sanded expanse of its hinoki-wood sushi bar. Much of my time was spent in a fog of pleasure, sitting dumbfounded on the shores of excess.
There is no menu and no choice afforded customers beyond deciding whether you want to spend an extra $120 for a plate of thinly sliced wagyu tataki with summer truffles. (In for a penny!) You simply surrender to the restaurant’s will, which is no trial.
The quality of the ingredients and preparations were sometimes breathtaking. This was true from that toro-and-caviar dish that started my meals through the elegant kaiseki-style preparation of sea trout in a shabu-shabu broth, and from an indulgent bite of shaved summer truffles pressed onto <dish>sushi rice</dish> on through course after course of <dish>sushi</dish> to the grapefruit granité that signaled the end of recent meals.
The sushi particularly astonished. Takahiro Sakaeda, the chef who prepared two of my meals, paced the evenings with the studied wickedness of a great D.J. or playwright, building acts into the meal, replete with turning points, subplots and rising action. (Speaking of: on one night, Mr. Takayama did not even seem to be in the restaurant.)
Nearly all the <dish>fish</dish> Mr. Sakaeda prepared came from Japan, save some orange clam that one evening he allowed, with a small smile, to be local. There was horse mackerel and the deep-sea snapper known as kinmedai, squid and sea bream and fat red shrimp, all cut beautifully and served over ever-so-slightly warm sushi rice: a near-perfect vehicle for the <dish>fish</dish>. Mr. Sakaeda dressed these himself under a whisper of soy or a grain of Himalayan salt, depending, and passed them along like gifts.
There was soft, unctuous saltwater eel under the lightest dusting of yuzu zest, a zip that offset the marvelous oil of the <dish>fish</dish>. And there was delicate grilled tuna sinew, a vile texture transformed through fire into a silky, transcendent one, amazing to behold.
Mr. Sakaeda proved himself a brilliant guide to the gifts of the sea: a careful chef and eager teacher who rewarded interest with insight, pleasure with yet more.
But extraordinary food alone does not an extraordinary restaurant make. The experience of eating at Masa can clash, sometimes greatly, with the grace, simplicity and excellence of the cuisine on display.
One night I entered the 26-seat restaurant five minutes before my reservation time, arriving before my three guests. The room was empty, save for servers and one occupied table in the dining room. The woman at the restaurant’s front checked my (fake) name off a short list of reservations on a piece of paper on a block of wood in front of her. She took my briefcase and placed it in a closet.
Then: “You may wait outside,” she said. “When you return with your guests, please have your cellphone turned off or on silent.”
Masa is on the fourth floor of the Time Warner Center, in the midst of the mall’s vaunted Restaurant Collection, an assemblage that includes Per Se and Porter House in addition to Masa and its prêt-à-porter satellite restaurant, Bar Masa. Per Se is next door. It is hard to imagine anyone there asking a diner to wait outside for his guests.
There are other wrinkles in Masa’s fine silk. At the <dish>sushi</dish> bar it is not uncommon for the prepared dishes served at the start of a meal, which are brought to the bar by servers, to be placed before customers with no explanation whatsoever. In the dining room it is possible for the same lapse to occur with the arrival of the sushi. It is unsettling, given the luxury of the food, and the question of its cost.
Some will take issue with the fact that Masa serves an enormous amount of <dish>bluefin tuna</dish>, a <dish>fish</dish> that some say hovers on the brink of collapse as a species. (The reason is presumably simple: its taste.) Others will cavil at the manner in which Mr. Takayama caters to some guests in the restaurant while ignoring others, in seemingly direct proportion to the amount of money they are spending.
(“Come stay with us in Sun Valley,” a burgher said to Mr. Takayama one night, handing him a glass of Montrachet. “I’ll fly you in.” Mr. Takayama raised the wine and laughed.)
Finally, meals at the restaurant end with a clank: you are given a dessert and it throws a switch. Everyone turns away and you will have little contact with the staff until you find someone to give you the bill. Guests stare at one another awkwardly: What do we do now?
At the end of its first year in business, Frank Bruni awarded Masa four stars in these pages, the newspaper’s highest rating. Masa was the first Japanese restaurant to achieve four stars since Hatsuhana was reviewed by Mimi Sheraton in 1983. (Ms. Sheraton praised that restaurant’s tempura and its inside-out rolls, while noting that the prices were lower than at other sushi restaurants in the city: “$100 for two, with tax, tip and three Scotches each.”)
Masa, Mr. Bruni noted, “is very much a restaurant of this time and place.”
That is perhaps no longer the case. Bruised by recession, wizened by experience, gun-shy about the future, New York City now demands of its four-star restaurants an understanding that culture at its highest must never feel transactional, whatever its cost. We ascend to these heavens for total respite from the world below, for extraordinary service and luxuriant atmosphere as much as for the quality of the food prepared.
Masa is the city’s greatest <dish>sushi</dish> restaurant. That is not nothing.
