With a 40-minute wait on a Sunday night, the feeding at The Meatball Shop, a neo-retro Lower East Sider dressed in vintage photos and meat-grinder parts, is so frenzied it feels Pavlovian. Say “meatball” in this town, and everyone’s inner child comes out noshing.
Too bad these <dish>house-ground balls</dish> (four for $7), served with your choice of four sauces, aren’t roundly delicious.
The <dish>beef</dish> isn’t meaty enough; the inconsistent <dish>chicken</dish> was moist one day, dry the next; the <dish>salmon</dish> was too fishy.
But the <dish>lamb</dish>, a special one night, was tasty, ground kofta-style with mint, walnuts and raisins. And the <dish>cherry-pepper-spiked pork</dish> is as zesty and porcine as it ought to be.
It’s particularly zingy bathed in the spicy meat sauce. The mushroom gravy paired satisfyingly with the <dish>mushroomy vegetable balls</dish>, but the Parmesan cream sauce clashed with everything.
These pliable meatballs want firm contrast, so if you order them on a <dish>sandwich</dish> instead of over 
 ($11) resist the <dish>soft brioche “smash”</dish> ($8) and <dish>sliders</dish> ($3) and go for the <dish>crusty baguette hero</dish> ($9) instead.
Forgo the <dish>pasty white beans</dish>, oversteamed <dish>broccoli</dish>, and undercooked <dish>polenta</dish> (each $4), and enjoy a brisk <dish>baby arugula and apple</dish> 
 on the side ($4).
It’ll cleanse your palate nicely, but not nearly as nicely as the homemade mint 
. Wedged between nutty brownie 
 in one of several build-your-own <dish>ice cream sandwiches</dish> for dessert ($4), it soothes even the crankiest kid, young or old.
