After 
, Floyd Cardoz doesn’t owe New York anything. In his 11 years as the chef of that restaurant across from Madison Square Park, he used the language of Indian cuisine to say things we had never heard before.
A native of Mumbai, he showed us that the Indian spice cabinet can perform many other tricks besides curry. Upstairs at Tabla, he helped end the era in which the fine-dining wing of the restaurant business operated as a club to which cuisines of non-European descent need not apply. At the bottom of the winding staircase, in the little lounge known as Bread Bar, he showed us that a serious chef could pull off a more affordable and accessible menu without pandering.
Restaurants that change people’s perceptions don’t come along very often, though. So in assessing Mr. Cardoz’s new restaurant, 
, it’s more productive to view the things it does well (and there are a lot) as a bonus, without getting caught up in the ways in which it doesn’t quite live up to Tabla.
The next two jobs Mr. Cardoz held in New York after Tabla closed in 2010 took him away from Indian cooking. In theory, 
 and White Street could have set him free. In practice, neither gave free rein to his talents.
Luckily for him and for us, he is his own boss at Paowalla, and he’s cooking Indian food again. Reaching into his back catalog, Mr. Cardoz is serving some dishes and even a couple of cocktails, like the mind-clearing cucumber-gin highball called the Kachumber Cooler, that are flashbacks to Tabla and Bread Bar.
He found a corner spot in SoHo that used to be an Italian restaurant. The wood-fueled pizza oven in the middle of the dining room was a stroke of luck, fitting in with the theme that also led to the name. Paowalla means bread seller, and breads lead the menu. They come in many shapes and sizes, from the familiar standards like naans and rotis to more exotic forms.
<dish>Pao</dish> are yeasted dinner rolls, a Portuguese-derived specialty of Goa with a slight, charming sweetness. (If you grew up with Parker house rolls, you want to drop a pat of butter on them.) The white spirals called <dish>tingmo</dish> are Tibetan steamed buns, which Mr. Cardoz treats like cinnamon rolls with chile paste where the cinnamon should be.
<dish>Rosemary naan</dish> had almost no rosemary flavor, and <dish>naan</dish> stuffed with minced bacon wasn’t as irresistible as it should have been. But the <dish>kulcha</dish> filled with Cheddar was improbably wonderful.
I understand why Mr. Cardoz has put the breads at the top of the batting order on his menu. But I think his policy of automatically serving them first, with nothing but chutneys to accompany them, is a mistake. These breads deserve to be on the table in the company of other food. They’re a little lonely on their own.
A lot of the menu is made up of small plates, many of them snacklike and many served with bread, to the benefit of both bread and snack. The <dish>melting roasted bone marrow</dish> is terrific spread on sliced pao and drizzled with a thrilling chutney of fresh herbs and curry leaves. Potato fritters are sandwiched between halves of pao in a fun evocation of wada pao, a Mumbai street snack.
A <dish>curried shrimp turnover</dish> is a homage to one that Mr. Cardoz remembers eating as a child on the beaches in Goa. I’d remember a hand pie this good, too. Another street snack he’s toying around with is <dish>chaat</dish>; the night I had it, he was making it with sweet potatoes and apples, an untraditional assemblage that made perfect sense.
One likably eccentric aspect of Mr. Cardoz’s menu at North End Grill was the raft of egg dishes. Eggs make a more limited, but still memorable, appearance at Paowalla. <dish>Scrambled eggs patia</dish> are sultry with ginger and very, very soft; like the marrow, they come with sliced pao. <dish>Eggs kejriwal</dish>, meanwhile, is simple and totally likable: a sunny-side-up egg on toast ratcheted up by a green-chile chutney.
With the larger plates, the playfulness and street-food allusions are mostly left behind. The results can be mixed.
Mr. Cardoz has an excellent idea for getting New Yorkers to eat <dish>dal</dish>: He drops a globe of burrata in the middle of the plate. It’s one of the only large plates without meat or fish; in general, it’s a little tricker to eat a vegetarian meal at Paowalla than it should be.
I wanted more flavor from the pork in <dish>baby pig vindaloo</dish> and a higher sour-to-sweet ratio from the sauce. And I wanted the <dish>bacon-and-chorizo biryani</dish> to be different in any number of ways: less saturated with smoke, more aromatic with spices, and probably cheaper than the $57 Paowalla is charging for it, although I might not whine about the price of this family-size portion if I had liked the way it tasted.
The seafood main courses, though, tended to be very good, including the dogfish rubbed with a mildly spicy coating of coconut and tomatoes and then steamed inside a banana-leaf packet, or the whole sea bream roasted with a thick vein of vinegared spice paste inside.
The menu sprawls, offering more than enough reasons to try Paowalla once. Whether you will come back depends on how much you mind the peculiarly disjointed dining space and service that can be unintentionally maddening.
At first glance, Paowalla looks like a cozy neighborhood retreat, but several design decisions make it peculiarly uncomfortable. A row of stools facing a window puts anyone who sits there up for the inspection of pedestrians on Sullivan Street. The back end of the dining room is separated by a steel-and-glass partition, turning one medium-size space into two cramped, awkward ones and doing a real number on the acoustics. The most comfortable and, oddly enough, most peaceful evening I had at Paowalla was spent at a sidewalk table.
That night was also free of a hovering, mosquitolike service style that I encountered inside. Once I had been spotted, somebody was always leaning in to clear a glass, or fill one, or wipe the table, or make room for another plate. When a new course arrived, before anybody had a chance to try any of it, I heard a question that was new to me.
“First impressions?”
It’s bad enough to be asked, as happens more and more often lately, “How are the first few bites tasting?” If we have to give opinions on how the food looks without tasting it, we may as well stay home looking at Instagram.
