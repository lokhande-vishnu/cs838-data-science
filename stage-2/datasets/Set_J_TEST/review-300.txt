It is a dish that unfolds in panorama: on one end, a bowl of smoky collards, the leaves sweated until just soft, with hunks of <dish>bacon</dish> waiting to be flushed out of the undergrowth; then spoonbread, made with white cornmeal and given breath by whipped <dish>egg whites</dish> so it has the body of a soufflé and the heart of a pudding; and, last, quail, brined, soaked in buttermilk and dredged in flour and Old Bay seasoning, its dainty legs under ruffles of crisp skin.
Some might find this effete, a chef’s attempt to turn <dish>fried chicken haute</dish>. But quail is a Southern staple, a hunter’s bird, trophy for gentry and hardscrabble alike, stalked in the pines, downed by Pop’s shotgun and dressed for Christmas breakfast. It has less flesh than chicken but is meatier, with a streak of wildness.
, which opened in October in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, is broadly American in mission, with an occasional Southern twang. The owners, Lev Gewirtzman and Jacques Belanger, are chefs and alumni of 
, on the Upper West Side. (Here Mr. Gewirtzman is going solo in the kitchen, while Mr. Belanger sees to the front of the house.) The restaurant’s name is a hat tip to Curtis Mayfield, the soul singer, songwriter and civil rights advocate.
To aspire to soul is at once laudable and hazardous. It’s a welcome surprise that Mr. Gewirtzman gets so much right.
Not every trained chef treats the deep fryer with such respect. Clam bellies, flopped in more of that flour and Old Bay, come out as tender and juicy as a backwater shack’s. <dish>Fish</dish> arrive in clouds of batter leavened with club soda, oysters in fluffy hides of cornmeal.
They are likely to share the table with more-constructed dishes, like leeks poached in <dish>mushroom stock</dish> and arranged like a divining rod around a delicate porcini custard, or a ceviche of fluke and grapefruit, buzzed by pickled Fresno chiles. But even here you are not meant to stand on ceremony: that ceviche is a little too pristine on its own, and requires a good pummeling by the accompanying smoked-paprika popcorn.
A dish labeled on the menu as <dish>octopus</dish> turns out to be a thin cut of <dish>pork belly</dish> over white beans simmered with pork-belly scraps. There is <dish>octopus</dish> on the plate, tendrils forlorn in a corner, but who cares: it is an interloper on the true business at hand, the communion of <dish>pork and beans</dish>.
Mayfield strays a little from the new Brooklyn path. Ingredients are locally produced, but they aren’t handled like precious objects. There are those earthy, flawless collards; and poor-man’s turnips playing hide-and-seek with Nantucket bay scallops; and remains of ravaged brussels sprouts buried in farro. The entrees fulfill their duty, substantial without too many complications: a <dish>pork chop</dish> wrapped in prosciutto and sage; a whole roasted trout, gutted, stuffed with cured lemons and tarragon, slapped over fingerling potatoes and filigreed with a classic béarnaise.
Afterward, there will be a small round apple upside-down cake nearly dwarfed by its turban of vanilla ice cream, and an equally petite lemon cheesecake with a toss of pomegranate seeds. You would not want more. (Except, perhaps, another serving of spoonbread.)
The dining room is deep and dim, with amber bars of light along exposed-brick walls that keep most of the illumination to themselves. Everything takes on a sepia tinge. Somehow this feels uncontrived. You almost believe that the battered wooden folding chairs (pews from a Kentucky church) were purchased out of necessity, not aesthetics.
There are those who still consider this kind of restaurant an encroachment in Crown Heights. But the prices are gentler than you find at points due west, the mood more practical. Asked about the $1 oysters special at a recent happy hour, the waitress said firmly, “Just because they’re a dollar doesn’t mean they’re not good.”
