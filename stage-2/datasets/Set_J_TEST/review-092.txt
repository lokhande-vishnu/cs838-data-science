A SEAFOOD shack should be a little tumbledown, possibly decrepit, with insufficient parking and oil-stained cartons of <dish>fried mollusks</dish> dispensed brusquely through a window. You should eat at a picnic table, salt wind whipping your hair into your mouth, or take your haul down a poison-ivy-laced path to the beach, fending off stalker gulls. There should be a sunset that lasts half the night, and nowhere else you need to be.
Instead, here you are in New York City, on a harassed stretch of Hell’s Kitchen, sidewalks pocked with ancient gum. At this unpromising address, Claw, a 
-roll specialist, opened in May. (Its original location, in Chelsea, opened in January and has since closed for renovations.)
The interior is cream and queasy coral pink, the ghost of bridesmaid dresses past. But the lobster is vivid, shipped live from Maine and steamed on site. Served warm, on a brimming-over toasted Martin’s <dish>potato roll</dish>, the meat — a mix of tail, knuckle and claw — is practically naked, with the faintest gloss of drawn butter and a coat of mayo so light it is practically invisible to the eye ($17).
For this you can almost forgive the arid <dish>crab beignets</dish> ($8). But not the cruelty of immuring lobster in a limp <dish>quesadilla</dish> ($12) or consigning it to a soggy grave of <dish>mac and cheese</dish> ($12). Show some respect.
The mood is more blithe at Grey Lady, which opened in May on the Lower East Side. Loiterers at the long marble-topped bar have the air of preppy surfers who will be fox-hunting come fall. The restaurant’s name salutes befogged Nantucket, where the owners summered when young.
This is the seafood shack by way of Ralph Lauren: grainy sunlight through floor-to-ceiling windows, pale beach-glass bottles, matrices of mismatched mirrors and black-and-white photographs, burlap pillows askew on a dusty blue leather couch. It harks back to the kind of New England seaside resort that has no locks on the doors and little recreation beyond adultery and highballs.
With this atmosphere, the food does not have to be good, but it is. Bluefish is smoked and whipped into a fluffy <dish>pâté</dish> ($10), its oiliness discreetly airbrushed out. Enormous chunks of lobster, fresh from Maine, swell out of a fried split-top roll stained gold and exuding butter ($25). (Note that the same roll, minus a little meat and the beautiful crowd, is available for only $18 next door at the restaurant’s recently added takeout counter, Downeast Clam Shack.)
But you want quirky. So off to Brooklyn. A block from the Red Hook waterfront stands Brooklyn Crab, a shanty writ large, three stories high and already looking faintly dilapidated, although it was built this past year. (The restaurant runs a free shuttle from the nearest subway stop during peak hours.)
The décor, if such a word applies, involves giant gaping fiberglass fish, lobster traps and twinkle lights. Out back are rustic bean-bag-toss stations and a bare-bones miniature golf course in a sea of gray and red gravel.
The bottom level is essentially a holding pen where people wait, sometimes for hours, for a proper meal on one of the upper levels. (Drinks and limited food are available, perhaps to prevent an uprising.)
When your name is finally called, you mount the stairs with such hope. The details are right: wooden booths and picnic tables, tin buckets stuffed with paper plates, rolls of paper towels, salt and pepper in recycled Coronita bottles. In the distance, past the Fairway parking lot, you see gray water.
The <dish>fried clams</dish> are fluffy, with briny bellies ($15); the lobster simply, beautifully charred ($29). But it is too late. You did not wait this long for a mushy <dish>crab cake</dish> ($14) and a <dish>steam pot</dish> with tough shrimp ($40).
Think what you could have done with those lost hours: hit Interstate 95, lighted out for the Vineyard. Or just popped down the street to the Red Hook Lobster Pound, bought a perfect Connecticut-style, butter-only <dish>lobster roll</dish> ($16), and eaten it slowly off the hood of your car, watching the sky set itself on fire.
