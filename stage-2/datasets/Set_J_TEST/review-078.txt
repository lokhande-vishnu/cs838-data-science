Cariño
Mexican
82 South Fourth Street ,

Cariño stands a few blocks from what was Bonita, the Mexican adjunct to the Marlow & Sons mini-empire. That was where Cariño’s owners and almost all its staff members toiled, some for more than seven years, until their bosses closed the restaurant last summer.
Undaunted, they banded together to start a restaurant of their own. Cariño opened its doors in May. El pueblo unido!
But don’t expect a whiff of revolution at your table. Cariño is a genial place to spend an evening, its version of Mexican food reliable, if a trifle subdued. It is, in other words, not unlike Bonita.
The restaurant’s garagelike storefront has a munificent glass front and breathing room between the tables. There’s no fussy attempt at design, just some exposed brick, a few mirrors, low candles and a statuette of the Virgin on a shelf.
The cooks, who hail from Puebla and Oaxaca, are nimble with the standards: <dish>gently stuffed tacos</dish> ($7 to $9), <dish>taquitos dorados striped with salsa verde</dish> ($4 to $5), <dish>grilled corn</dish> with a slap of mayo and a sift of chili powder ($4).
A moment of blissful silence greeted the arrival of the <dish>gordita</dish> ($7), a fat  deep-fried masa dumpling sliced open to reveal chorizo smoking at its center. Oozing crema, tomatillo sauce and cheese, it is a direct challenge to the hegemony of the burger.
You can enjoy the dishes here without remembering them later. An exception is <dish>Ricardo’s guacamole</dish> ($8), made with papalo, an herb native to Mexico that has a peppery jab and a lemony afterglow. It evokes cilantro, but with more va-va-voom.
Where Cariño one-ups Bonita is at the full bar, which offers nearly 50 tequilas and a smattering of mezcals. Bypass the over-sweet margaritas for a Herradura Silver ($8), with its long spearmint fade, or a minerally Gran Centenario Añejo ($12). Sip slowly and forget, for a moment, that tomorrow you’ll be back working for the man.
