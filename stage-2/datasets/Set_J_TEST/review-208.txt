GANSO does not announce  . It is half-hidden on a bland tangent off the Fulton Street Mall in
Downtown Brooklyn, at a midpoint between Armani Exchange and IHOP. You will know it by the clusters
of people lurking on the sidewalk, waiting to warm their faces over bowls of ramen. Inside is a
geometry of raw cedar, angular booths roomy enough for three to squeeze in on each side and a long
banquette lined with blocky (and surprisingly comfortable) stools. In the back, counter seats and
smaller booths built for two leave the narrowest of aisles for the servers to run and run. The chef,
Rio Irie, a native of Japan, was second in command to Tadashi Ono at Matsuri, which is now
shuttered. He may be spied in the glassed-in kitchen, looking slightly meditative even at the height
of service, a pair of chopsticks thrust into the back pocket of his jeans. One of the owners, Harris
Salat, is a Brooklyn-born devotee of Japanese   and a co-author of three Japanese cookbooks (two of
which happen to be sitting on my kitchen shelf). He plies the floor, bussing bowls and thanking
diners for coming, while Portishead loops blurrily on the speakers. The menu reads as a catalog of
straightforward pleasures: gyoza (pot stickers), pork buns, wings. Then the <dish>gyoza</dish> ($7) arrive,
upside down, their browned undersides laced together by a frill of translucent, crackly dough. Flip
them over and note the scrupulous, verging-on-obsessive-compulsive pleats. Inside, they burst with
juicy pork and garlic chives, and barely require the accompanying chile-soy sauce. <dish>Lunar-white bao
buns come with pork belly</dish> and a slap of kimchi, mined with jalapeño for good measure ($9), and
<dish>tonkatsu</dish>, panko-breaded pork brushed with a sauce akin to Worcestershire and planted atop chile
mayonnaise, a meld of flavors that evokes, in the best way, a Big Mac’s special sauce ($9). <dish>Chicken
wings</dish> ($8) are a feat of engineering, the crust blistered and coppery, the sauce a mere evanescence
of sweetness. Why, then, on a recent evening was the <dish>fried chicken </dish>($8), confetti-size pieces of
minced chicken leg presented in a dainty basket, absent all trace of seasoning? Where in the
<dish>salt-grilled mackerel</dish> ($10) was the salt? A tendency toward overdelicacy extends to the ramen. While
the noodles have tooth, the broths are puzzlingly reticent. You detect layers of flavor, complicated
equations of alkalinity and suspended fat, and yet, and yet: they have nuance and dimension, but no
impact. Of the five variations of ramen available (most of them made with a stock of pork and
chicken bones), only the spicy miso, given body by a tare (seasoning base) of coarsely ground red
miso, offers flagrant pleasure. Still, they are so meticulously made, you wonder for a moment if
you’re missing something. Some ramen broths detonate at first spoonful, then fizzle out halfway
through; others start off meek and turn carnal. Ganso aspires to the latter. After my initial
disappointment, I kept eating, idly, expecting nothing, and as I dragged up broth from the bottom of
the bowl, the flavors began to deepen and assert themselves. What I had thought nebulous took on a
distinct point of view. But some of my dining companions never got that far, abandoning hope a few
spoonfuls in. No MSG is used, no artificial flavor boosters.
