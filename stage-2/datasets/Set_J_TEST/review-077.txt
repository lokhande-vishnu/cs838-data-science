At upscale barbecue restaurants in Seoul, the hostess will not only take your coat, but also seal it in plastic: it’s protection from the grease and smoke that normally accompany the meeting of meat, marinade and fire.
 which opened in March near the Morgan Library and Museum, brings that approach to an entire restaurant, buffing the experience with marble tables, crystal grills and an upstairs lounge with glittering banquettes. Uniformed waiters even grill the meat for you. (Traditionally, the host cooks, or each person takes on the task.)
The chef, David Shim, has worked at some top New York kitchens but does not try to rewrite the classics, only to refine them. The tone is set with the first appetizer, <dish>gujeolpan</dish> ($15). Tiny rice crepes are spread out like flower petals, and the fillings (slivered mushrooms, seaweed, sweet onions and more) set out in small heaps so diners can roll their own. Three kinds of crisp savory <dish>pancakes</dish> (jeon, $14) come out hot and light, perfect with shots of soju ($16 to $18 a bottle), the sweetish liquor that quickly sets the mood for a communal meal. (Beer usually follows.)
The grills are gas-powered and quiet, at least when they work; there is often an unnerving period of clicking before flames finally lick the thick, clear plate. When the grill is heating, the banchan (kimchi and other pickles and 
) appear. All the beef is <dish>Wagyu </dish>($29 to $47), served entirely plain, not marinated; the tastiest cut is galbi, heavily marbled short ribs cut across the grain. Cold paper-thin rounds of lightly pickled daikon are served, for wrapping the hot beef; like the crunchy salt and sesame sauce, it’s a lovely touch.
For the barbecue-averse, there are stews, classic noodle dishes and a spectacularly precise <dish>bibimbap</dish> ($18), with perfectly cooked rice and vegetables. The <dish>bulgogi jungol for two</dish> ($56), beef stew cooked at the table, can feed several. The enormous pile of marinated beef, mushrooms, scallions and broth simmers down into a stew, and the liquid is repurposed to cook rice and seaweed.
Even the desserts ($10) are unusual and good, cooling and sweet variations on 
 and mochi.
