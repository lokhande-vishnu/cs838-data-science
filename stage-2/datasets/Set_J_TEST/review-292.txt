Zabb Elee
Thai
75 Second Avenue,

IS a puzzlement: a Thai restaurant that does not serve pad Thai. There’s also no roster of coconutty curries, no clear demarcation between appetizers and entrees and just one small section of <dish>Bangkok rice and noodles</dish>. The bulk of the menu, evidently, hails from beyond the country’s capital.
Indeed, Zabb Elee (pronounced sab EE-lee) features food from Isan, the region of northeast Thailand that borders Laos and Cambodia. Many of the cuisine’s Laotian-leaning dishes, like larb and green papaya 
, have percolated into other Thai menus in New York, but seldom with such freshness and complexity of flavor. Or, on request, such spicy heat.
Zabb Elee opened several months ago at a site in the East Village previously occupied by a series of Southeast Asian restaurants, all under the same ownership. (Two, SEA Thai Bistro and Spice, still maintain other locations in the city.)
The dining room, past awkward double doors and down a short flight of stairs, is bright and sparingly decorated; a pop soundtrack is faint. All attention — and, at dinnertime, commotion — centers on shared plates prepared by Ratchanee Sumpatboon, once the chef of Poodam’s, an Isan restaurant, now closed, in Astoria, Queens. (To her friends, the chef is called, simply, Poo.)
The <dish>larb</dish> ($9) — a <dish>moist minced-meat salad</dish>, lively with shallots, scallions, mint, cilantro, chile and lime, with a toasty note from pulverized roasted rice — appears in no fewer than eight luscious varieties. Duck, beef and catfish are particularly good, especially with a pinch of <dish>sticky rice</dish> ($2), deposited in a curl of crisp cabbage and popped in the mouth.
Many dishes on Zabb’s roster of som tum, or <dish>green papaya salad</dish> ($8 to $10), take a pungent note from plara, a fermented fish sauce. The most striking variation, som tum poo plara, incorporates a crab that has been pickled, then chopped to pieces. Sucking on bright blue legs and claws has a certain spicy-sweet-herbal payoff; just don’t expect lump crab meat, or clean fingers.
Grilled and fried dishes, offered in abundance, include juicy kai yang, or <dish>grilled marinated chicken</dish> ($9), and an even better <dish>grilled squid</dish> ($9), nicely charred, exceptionally tender. <dish>Grilled catfish</dish> ($14) was a tad dried out; so were deep-<dish>fried pork spareribs</dish> ($8). A minimalist skewer of <dish>chicken hearts</dish>, gizzards and livers ($2) was accompanied by a intriguing, tart tamarind sauce. Some other sauces, however, seemed thin, plain, less well paired.
These plates, do note, arrive in quick succession, if not all at once. It’s best to order that drink straight off: a dark Beerlao or a Singha ($6 each), a tall glass of pale green palm juice ($3) or perhaps just a Thai iced tea ($3).
The menu is a-jumble with much more worth exploring. From five soups ($9 each) deeply flavored by basil, galangal, lemon grass and chile, one named toam zabb kha moo was fat with long-stewed, supertender “pork leg.” Sai kroog Esan ($6) partnered the namesake sour pork sausage with ginger, peanuts and chiles, for customized mouthfuls balancing tangy, salty, spicy and sour.
<dish>Gang som</dish> ($9), a curry that is spicy and a bit sweet, sported bright yellow bamboo and papaya and a half-dozen shrimp. Terrific crispy pork is served with sautéed morning glory ($8) and in several other combinations.
For palates seeking something tame, a simple plate of kao mun kai ($8) offers steamed chicken accompanied by ginger rice. Afterward, chunks of 
 in warm coconut milk ($3) go down sweetly and gently, too.
The chef made one particularly delightful dish at Poodam’s that also appears at Zabb Elee: hor mok ($11). Not an Isan dish, hor mok is a holdover from the colonial days of French Indochina. It’s not a dessert, either, but steamed curry fish custard is a fine way to finish a meal.
