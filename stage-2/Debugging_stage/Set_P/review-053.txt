Agua Fresca



In East Harlem, 116th Street is a raucous corridor. But descend into Agua Fresca’s snug, golden dining room, one quiet block north, and it might be another country. At a glance, the menu is Mexican; a soundtrack veering into Latin contemporary and cool jazz hints at more.
The chef, Adrian Leon, was born in Mexico City. But as at his now-closed Zona Rosa, Mr. Leon uses Latin American flavors (chimichurri especially) that are less widely used in his home country, as well as traditional flavors in deft combinations.
<dish>Tacos</dish> ($6.95 to $7.95 for three) might pair <dish>braised tongue</dish> with grilled onion, shrimp with pineapple. Discretionary condiments include two superb house-made sauces, <dish>smoky red morita pepper</dish> and <dish>creamy green tomatillo</dish>.
Some presentations, like a three-dollop <dish>guacamole</dish> tasting ($12.95), are too precious. Yes, it is art, but soon it is gone. Dive in for a full portion (say, the colorado, invigorated with chipotle paste). Dinner entrees have heft (even so, my companions guarded their plates jealously). A <dish>pork chop</dish> ($15.95), lush with pasilla chile sauce, was buttressed by mashed plantain; <dish>herb-roasted chicken</dish> ($14.95), with crispy potatoes, was seasoned more subtly than its rotisserie kin. <dish>Pan-seared tilapia</dish> ($16.95) rested on moist coconut rice, inflected with jalapeño and ginger, that smacked of Southeast Asia.
<dish>Seafood enchiladas</dish> (lunch only, $8.95) balanced jalapeño heat against queso fresco cool. The <dish>tortilla chips in chilaquiles</dish> (brunch only, $11.95), often soggy, were crisp beneath chile sauce, crowned with juicy skirt steak.
There are Mexican beers and South American wines, a half-dozen each. It’s a pity, though, that Agua Fresca prepares only one daily variety of its namesake soft drink ($3), typically a sweet-tart blend of pineapple with orange, maybe mango.
The most tempting dessert might be <dish>churros</dish> ($5 each). On nearby street carts, these dough sticks are deep-fried in advance and stacked like cordwood; here they’re freshly baked, accompanied by limber house-made dulce de leche. Get ’em while they’re hot.
