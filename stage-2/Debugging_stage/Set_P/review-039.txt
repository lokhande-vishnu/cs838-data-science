Earl's Beer and Cheese

First-time patrons are easy to spot. Watch for the distinctive expression as they enter: a raised eyebrow (“How did this place get here?”) undercut with an anxious pout (“What do I do?”).
Earl’s is comically tiny and doesn’t look much like a bar. A picnic table takes up half the room; drinks and food are ordered from a back counter. The mise-en-scène is a mash-up of ironic hunting lodge and 19th-century tenement.
But behind the whimsy, there’s some serious ambition. The owners, Michael Cesari and Adam Clark, have turned their limited means into virtues.
Four taps pour a rotation of excellent American niche beers ($5 to $7). Over an evening, the Chatham IPA may be switched out for Stranger Pale Ale, a Kelso swapped with a Keegan. There’s more good crafty stuff in cans ($3 to $8), and a couple of organic wines ($7 to $8), drinkable enough, for those who want to swim against the current.
The ace in the hole is the chef, Corey Cova, and his menu of ingeniously goofball cheese-focused bar food. A <dish>mozzarella sandwich</dish> on an <dish>English muffin</dish> ($6) hits every taste and texture button: silken cheese, potato chips for crunch, pickle slices for tang and a healthy swipe of miso-flavored mayonnaise (a condiment that would be ubiquitous in a just world). The cheddar/sourdough option ($8), with <dish>kimchi</dish>, a <dish>fried egg</dish> and <dish>crunchy chunks of pork belly</dish>, is almost as good.
Mr. Cova’s haute low-brow aesthetic is carried to stunt-y extremes in the <dish>Earl’s Eggo</dish>, a supermarket waffle with foie gras, bacon and a square of Cheddar ($17). Discordant and aggressively salty, it probably sounded better in theory.
But <dish>chewy Korean rice cakes</dish> served as <dish>Asian gnocchi</dish> ($10) live up to the concept. With a garlicky meat sauce and “cheese fries” straight from a package, it’s a late-night kitchen experiment gone wonderfully right.
