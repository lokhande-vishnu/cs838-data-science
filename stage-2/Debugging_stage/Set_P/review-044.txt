Monday night in Midtown, Broadway dark and tourists scarce, and a couple walks into Bar Americain to take the measure of the place five years into its run. This is not hard duty.
There are people in the bar sharing <dish>shrimp</dish> and glasses of , clinking glasses as if on a ship bound for Le Havre. There are office parties celebrating around the large round tables by the open kitchen, a few setups of in-laws and marrieds, some dudes in Brooks suits getting serious about <dish>rib-eyes</dish> and <dish>hash browns</dish>. It is festive in the restaurant, bubbling along well north of subdued, the sort of place where everyone is always laughing.
 opened Bar Americain in 2005, with Laurence Kretchmer. Neither man was present this evening, but it was no drag on the proceedings.
There were seafood cocktails to start, a tray of them, rich and plentiful: <dish>shrimp with tomatillo</dish>; <dish>fat crab meat</dish> with coconut.  These do much to illustrate the particularly American style of Mr. Flay’s cooking, which generally matches heat with sweet, rather than sour. They were gone in a minute.
<dish>Soft grits</dish> with <dish>Gulf shrimp</dish> ($15) came next, salty with bacon and bitten by garlic, and a <dish>red-pepper crab cake</dish> with red cabbage slaw ($19). There was <dish>baby spinach</dish>, <dish>toasted pecans</dish> and a <dish>spicy orange vinaigrette</dish> ($11).
<dish>Lamb chops</dish> ($34) replaced the salad then, with mustard barbecue sauce and a <dish>corn-and-collards tart</dish>, alongside a fat, bloody <dish>rib-eye</dish> ($39), thick-crusted in spices and served alongside the restaurant’s excellent steak sauce with a woodpile of <dish>French fries</dish>, and a side dish of <dish>cauliflower</dish> and <dish>goat-cheese</dish> gratin to share.
Bar Americain is still quite on top of its game.
