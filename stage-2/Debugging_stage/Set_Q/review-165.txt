Crunching on <dish>grilled pig snouts</dish> at a Thai restaurant in Brooklyn the other night, I reflected on how
far New York has come. The snouts and I were in Whiskey Soda Lounge Ny, which the chef Andy Ricker
opened in August. It serves as a way station where people can nosh and drink and watch Muay Thai
highlight reels while waiting for a table at Mr. Ricker’s   down the street. Whiskey Soda Lounge is
more than that, though.  It’s also a gallery of Thailand’s bar snacks, which you almost never see in
the United States except at Mr. Ricker’s other Whiskey Soda Lounge, in Portland, Ore. Along with
Khe-Yo, a new Laotian-inspired restaurant in TriBeCa, Whiskey Soda Lounge joins a busy crowd of
kitchens turning New Yorkers on to Asian dishes that we might have treated with extreme caution not
long ago. New Yorkers will pinch raw tripe in miso between chopsticks at   in the West Village, rip
crisp folds of <dish>grilled chicken</dish> skin from skewers at   in Chelsea, and line up for the softer morsels
of a lamb’s head at the scattered outposts of  . Our pain threshold for spice is rapidly climbing,
too. Blistering Isan cuisine has been taking over the Thai scene, and incendiary Sichuan food is
turning up all over, riding a great orange tide of chile oil. Whiskey Soda Lounge, in the Columbia
Street Waterfront District in Brooklyn, feeds the city’s appetites for both spice and novelty. To
tell the truth, that pig snout was so leathery that chewing on it was like getting nourishment from
an old football. But I dug into the <dish>crunchy pig tails</dish> and invitingly <dish>tender pork tongue</dish> beside it on
the plate, a constant special, dipping them into a dark and intense sauce called jaew, made from
soy, dried chilies and toasted ground rice. Jaew turned up again with deep-fried strips of marinated
pork called <dish>muu sawan</dish>, a sweet, crunchy and irresistible species of jerky. Offal anchors the <dish>tom
saep muu</dish>, a clay-pot soup in which a vivid hot-and-sour pork broth elevates the blunt flavors of
chopped heart, liver and tripe. One spoonful reminds you that the first cook who combined chilies,
lemon grass, Kaffir lime, galangal and lime juice deserved a   for aromatic sciences. The soup and
some other spicy dishes are not murderously hot, but they are not meek, either. The dressings on two
excellent salads — <dish>yam plaa meuk</dish>, or <dish>squid with tomatoes and celery</dish>, and <dish>yam het huu nuu khao</dish>,
tomatoes and scallions with ruffled white mouse-ear mushrooms — had the kind of warmth you feel in
your joints, not the kind that makes you want a tongue transplant.   There are gentler dishes, too.
A deep-fried Thai analogue to Scotch eggs, <dish>khai luuk khoei</dish>, comes with a relatively nonincendiary
tamarind dipping sauce, although you can crank up the heat with bits of toasted dried chilies. One
of Mr. Ricker’s most lovable hits, the <dish>Vietnamese-style chicken wings</dish> marinated in fish sauce and
garlic, can be ordered spicy or less spicy, and neither version is as fierce as the kind you’d find
in a sports bar. Drink a cocktail if spiciness becomes an issue. Drink a cocktail in any case,
because the ones at Whiskey Soda Lounge, like Pok Pok Ny, are fun and refreshing, and because the
food almost demands it.
